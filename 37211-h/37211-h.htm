<h2>By Way of Introduction</h2>


<p>This book is not the result of ordinary conventional
rambles, of sightseeing by day, and
flying by night, but rather of leisurely wanderings,
for a somewhat extended period, along
the banks of the Loire and its tributaries and
through the countryside dotted with those
splendid monuments of Renaissance architecture
which have perhaps a more appealing interest
for strangers than any other similar
edifices wherever found.</p>

<p>Before this book was projected, the conventional
tour of the château country had been
"done," Baedeker, Joanne and James's "Little
Tour" in hand. On another occasion Angers,
with its almost inconceivably real castellated
fortress, and Nantes, with its memories
of the "Edict" and "La Duchesse Anne,"
had been tasted and digested <i>en route</i> to a certain
little artist's village in Brittany.</p>

<p>On another occasion, when we were headed
due south, we lingered for a time in the upper<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">vi</a></span>
valley, between "the little Italian city of Nevers"
and "the most picturesque spot in the
world"&mdash;Le Puy.</p>

<p>But all this left certain ground to be covered,
and certain gaps to be filled, though the
author's note-books were numerous and full to
overflowing with much comment, and the artist's
portfolio was already bulging with its
contents.</p>

<p>So more note-books were bought, and, following
the genial Mark Twain's advice, another
fountain pen and more crayons and
sketch-books, and the author and artist set out
in the beginning of a warm September to fill
those gaps and to reduce, if possible, that series
of rambles along the now flat and now rolling
banks of the broad blue Loire to something
like consecutiveness and uniformity; with what
result the reader may judge.</p>

<h1>Castles and Châteaux</h1>

<h1>of Old Touraine</h1>

<h3>and the Loire Country</h3>


<hr />
<h2>CHAPTER I.<span class="pagenum"><a href="#Contents">To ToC</a></span></h2>

<h4>A GENERAL SURVEY</h4>


<p>Any account of the Loire and of the towns
along its banks must naturally have for its
chief mention Touraine and the long line of
splendid feudal and Renaissance châteaux
which reflect themselves so gloriously in its
current.</p>

<p>The Loire possesses a certain fascination
and charm which many other more commercially
great rivers entirely lack, and, while the
element of absolute novelty cannot perforce
be claimed for it, it has the merit of appealing
largely to the lover of the romantic and
the picturesque.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">2</a></span></p>

<p>A French writer of a hundred years ago dedicated
his work on Touraine to "Le Baron de
Langeais, le Vicomte de Beaumont, le Marquis
de Beauregard, le Comte de Fontenailles, le
Comte de Jouffroy-Gonsans, le Duc de Luynes,
le Comte de Vouvray, le Comte de Villeneuve,
<i>et als.</i>;" and he might have continued with a
directory of all the descendants of the <i>noblesse</i>
of an earlier age, for he afterward grouped
them under the general category of "<i>Propriétaires
des fortresses et châteaux les plus remarquables&mdash;au
point de vue historique ou
architectural</i>."</p>

<p>He was fortunate in being able, as he said,
to have had access to their "<i>papiers de famille</i>,"
their souvenirs, and to have been able
to interrogate them in person.</p>

<p>Most of his facts and his gossip concerning
the personalities of the later generations of
those who inhabited these magnificent establishments
have come down to us through later
writers, and it is fortunate that this should be
the case, since the present-day aspect of the
châteaux is ever changing, and one who views
them to-day is chagrined when he discovers,
for instance, that an iron-trussed, red-tiled
wash-house has been built on the banks of the
Cosson before the magnificent château of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">3</a></span>
Chambord, and that somewhere within the confines
of the old castle at Loches a shopkeeper
has hung out his shingle, announcing a newly
discovered dungeon in his own basement, accidentally
come upon when digging a well.</p>

<p>Balzac, Rabelais, and Descartes are the leading
literary celebrities of Tours, and Balzac's
"Le Lys dans la Vallée" will give one a more
delightful insight into the old life of the Tourangeaux
than whole series of guide-books and
shelves of dry histories.</p>

<p>Blois and its counts, Tours and its bishops,
and Amboise and its kings, to say nothing of
Fontevrault, redolent of memories of the
Plantagenets, Nantes and its famous "Edict,"
and its equally infamous "Revocation," have
left vivid impress upon all students of French
history. Others will perhaps remember Nantes
for Dumas's brilliant descriptions of the outcome
of the Breton conspiracy.</p>

<p>All of us have a natural desire to know more
of historic ground, and whether we make a
start by entering the valley of the Loire at the
luxurious midway city of Tours, and follow
the river first to the sea and then to the source,
or make the journey from source to mouth, or
vice versa, it does not matter in the least. We
traverse the same ground and we meet the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">4</a></span>
same varying conditions as we advance a hundred
kilometres in either direction.</p>

<p>Tours, for example, stands for all that is
typical of the sunny south. Prune and palm
trees thrust themselves forward in strong contrast
to the cider-apples of the lower Seine.
Below Tours one is almost at the coast, and
the <i>tables d'hôte</i> are abundantly supplied with
sea-food of all sorts. Above Tours the Orléannais
is typical of a certain well-to-do, matter-of-fact
existence, neither very luxurious
nor very difficult.</p>

<p>Nevers is another step and resembles somewhat
the opulence of Burgundy as to conditions
of life, though the general aspect of the
city, as well as a great part of its history, is
Italian through and through.</p>

<p>The last great step begins at Le Puy, in the
great volcanic <i>Massif Centrale</i>, where conditions
of life, if prosperous, are at least harder
than elsewhere.</p>

<p>Such are the varying characteristics of the
towns and cities through which the Loire flows.
They run the whole gamut from gay to earnest
and solemn; from the ease and comfort of
the country around Tours, almost sub-tropical
in its softness, to the grime and smoke of busy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">5</a></span>
St. Etienne, and the chilliness and rigours of
a mountain winter at Le Puy.</p>

<div class="figright">
<img src="images/illus023_small.jpg" alt="A Lace-maker of the Upper Loire" title="A Lace-maker of the Upper Loire" />
<div class="caption"><i><a href="images/illus023.jpg">A Lace-maker of the Upper Loire</a></i></div>
</div>

<p>These districts are all very full of memories
of events which have helped to build up the
solidarity of France of to-day, though the
Nantois still proudly proclaims himself a
Breton, and the Tourangeau will tell you that
his is the tongue, above all others, which
speaks the purest French,&mdash;and so on through
the whole category, each and every citizen of
a <i>petit pays</i> living up to his traditions to the
fullest extent possible.</p>

<p>In no other journey in France, of a similar
length, will one see as many varying contrasts
in conditions of life as he will along the length
of the Loire, the broad, shallow river which
St. Martin, Charles Martel, and Louis XI.,
the typical figures of church, arms, and state,
came to know so well.</p>

<p>Du Bellay, a poet of the Renaissance, has
sung the praises of the Loire in a manner unapproached
by any other topographical poet,
if one may so call him, for that is what he
really was in this particular instance.</p>

<p>There is a great deal of patriotism in it all,
too, and certainly no sweet singer of the
present day has even approached these lines,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">6</a></span>
which are eulogistic without being fulsome
and fervent without being lurid.</p>

<p>The verses have frequently been rendered
into English, but the following is as good as
any, and better than most translations, though
it is one of those fragments of "newspaper
verse" whose authors are lost in obscurity.</p>



<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Mightier to me the house my fathers made,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Than your audacious heads, O Halls of Rome!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">More than immortal marbles undecayed,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The thin sad slates that cover up my home;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">More than your Tiber is my Loire to me,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">More Palatine my little Lyré there;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And more than all the winds of all the sea,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The quiet kindness of the Angevin air."<br /></span>
</div></div>



<p>In history the Loire valley is rich indeed,
from the days of the ancient Counts of Touraine
to those of Mazarin, who held forth at
Nevers. Touraine has well been called the
heart of the old French monarchy.</p>

<p>Provincial France has a charm never known
to Paris-dwellers. Balzac and Flaubert were
provincials, and Dumas was a city-dweller,&mdash;and
there lies the difference between them.</p>

<p>Balzac has written most charmingly of Touraine
in many of his books, in "Le Lys dans
la Vallée" and "Le Curé de Tours" in particular;
not always in complimentary terms,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">7</a></span>
either, for he has said that the Tourangeaux
will not even inconvenience themselves to go
in search of pleasure. This does not bespeak
indolence so much as philosophy, so most of
us will not cavil. George Sand's country lies
a little to the southward of Touraine, and
Berry, too, as the authoress herself has said,
has a climate "<i>souple et chaud, avec pluie
abondant et courte</i>."</p>

<p>The architectural remains in the Loire valley
are exceedingly rich and varied. The feudal
system is illustrated at its best in the great
walled château at Angers, the still inhabited
and less grand château at Langeais, the ruins
at Cinq-Mars, and the very scanty remains of
Plessis-les-Tours.</p>

<p>The ecclesiastical remains are quite as great.
The churches are, many of them, of the first
rank, and the great cathedrals at Nantes, Angers,
Tours, and Orléans are magnificent examples
of the church-builders' art in the middle
ages, and are entitled to rank among the
great cathedrals, if not actually of the first
class.</p>

<p>With modern civic and other public buildings,
the case is not far different. Tours has
a gorgeous Hôtel de Ville, its architecture being
of the most luxuriant of modern French<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">8</a></span>
Renaissance, while the railway stations, even,
at both Tours and Orléans, are models of what
railway stations should be, and in addition are
decoratively beautiful in their appointments
and arrangements,&mdash;which most railway stations
are not.</p>

<p>Altogether, throughout the Loire valley
there is an air of prosperity which in a more
vigorous climate is often lacking. This in
spite of the alleged tendency in what is commonly
known as a relaxing climate toward
<i>laisser-aller</i>.</p>

<p>Finally, the picturesque landscape of the
Loire is something quite different from the
harder, grayer outlines of the north. All is of
the south, warm and ruddy, and the wooded
banks not only refine the crudities of a flat
shore-line, but form a screen or barrier to the
flowering charms of the examples of Renaissance
architecture which, in Touraine, at least,
are as thick as leaves in Vallambrosa.</p>

<p>Starting at Gien, the valley of the Loire begins
to offer those monumental châteaux which
have made its fame as the land of castles.
From the old fortress-château of Gien to the
Château de Clisson, or the Logis de la Duchesse
Anne at Nantes, is one long succession of florid
masterpieces, not to be equalled elsewhere.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">9</a></span></p>

<p>The true château region of Touraine&mdash;by
which most people usually comprehend the
Loire châteaux&mdash;commences only at Blois.
Here the edifices, to a great extent, take on
these superfine residential attributes which
were the glory of the Renaissance period of
French architecture.</p>

<div class="figright"><a href="images/illus029.jpg">
<img src="images/illus029_small.jpg" alt="The Loire Châteaux Map" title="The Loire Châteaux Map" />
</a>
</div>


<p>Both above and below Touraine, at Montrichard,
at Loches, and Beaugency, are still to
be found scattering examples of feudal fortresses
and donjons which are as representative
of their class as are the best Norman structures
of the same era, the great fortresses of
Arques, Falaise, Domfront, and Les Andelys
being usually accounted as the types which
gave the stimulus to similar edifices elsewhere.</p>

<p>In this same versatile region also, beginning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span>
perhaps with the Orléannais, are a vast number
of religious monuments equally celebrated.
For instance, the church of St. Benoit-sur-Loire
is one of the most important Romanesque
churches in all France, and the cathedral
of St. Gatien, with its "bejewelled façade,"
at Tours, the twin-spired St. Maurice at Angers,
and even the pompous, and not very good
Gothic, edifice at Orléans (especially noteworthy
because its crypt is an ancient work
anterior to the Capetian dynasty) are all wonderfully
interesting and imposing examples of
mediæval ecclesiastical architecture.</p>

<p>Three great tributaries enter the Loire below
Tours, the Cher, the Indre, and the Vienne.
The first has for its chief attractions the Renaissance
châteaux St. Aignan and Chenonceaux,
the Roman remains of Chabris, Thézée,
and Larçay, the Romanesque churches of
Selles and St. Aignan, and the feudal donjon
of Montrichard. The Indre possesses the château
of Azay-le-Rideau and the sombre fortresses
of Montbazon and Loches; while the
Vienne depends for its chief interest upon the
galaxy of fortress-châteaux at Chinon.</p>

<p>The Loire is a mighty river and is navigable
for nearly nine hundred kilometres of its
length, almost to Le Puy, or, to be exact, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">11</a></span>
the little town of Vorey in the Department of
the Haute Loire.</p>

<p>At Orléans, Blois, or Tours one hardly realizes
this, much less at Nevers. The river appears
to be a great, tranquil, docile stream,
with scarce enough water in its bed to make
a respectable current, leaving its beds and bars
of <i>sable</i> and <i>cailloux</i> bare to the sky.</p>

<p>The scarcity of water, except at occasional
flood, is the principal and obvious reason for
the absence of water-borne traffic, even though
a paternal ministerial department of the government
calls the river navigable.</p>

<p>At the times of the <i>grandes crues</i> there are
four metres or more registered on the big scale
at the Pont d'Ancenis, while at other times it
falls to less than a metre, and when it does
there is a mere rivulet of water which trickles
through the broad river-bottom at Chaumont,
or Blois, or Orléans. Below Ancenis navigation
is not so difficult, but the current is more
strong.</p>

<p>From Blois to Angers, on the right bank,
extends a long dike which carries the roadway
beside the river for a couple of hundred kilometres.
This is one of the charms of travel
by the Loire. The only thing usually seen on
the bosom of the river, save an occasional fish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span>ing
punt, is one of those great flat-bottomed
ferry-boats, with a square sail hung on a yard
amidships, such as Turner always made an
accompaniment to his Loire pictures, for conditions
of traffic on the river have not greatly
changed.</p>

<p>Whenever one sees a barge or a boat worthy
of classification with those one finds on the
rivers of the east or north, or on the great
canals, it is only about a quarter of the usual
size; so, in spite of its great navigable length,
the waterway of the Loire is to be considered
more as a picturesque and healthful element
of the landscape than as a commercial proposition.</p>

<p>Where the great canals join the river at Orléans,
and from Chatillon to Roanne, the traffic
increases, though more is carried by the canal-boats
on the <i>Canal Latéral</i> than by the barges
on the Loire.</p>

<p>It is only on the Loire between Angers and
Nantes that there is any semblance of river
traffic such as one sees on most of the other
great waterways of Europe. There is a considerable
traffic, too, which descends the Maine,
particularly from Angers downward, for Angers
with its Italian skies is usually thought
of, and really is to be considered, as a Loire<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span>
town, though it is actually on the banks of the
Maine some miles from the Loire itself.</p>

<p>One thousand or more bateaux make the ascent
to Angers from the Loire at La Pointe
each year, all laden with a miscellaneous cargo
of merchandise. The Sarthe and the Loir also
bring a notable agricultural traffic to the
greater Loire, and the smaller confluents, the
Dive, the Thouet, the Authion, and the Layon,
all go to swell the parent stream until, when
it reaches Nantes, the Loire has at last taken
on something of the aspect of a well-ordered
and useful stream, characteristics which above
Nantes are painfully lacking. Because of its
lack of commerce the Loire is in a certain way
the most noble, magnificent, and aristocratic
river of France; and so, too, it is also in respect
to its associations of the past.</p>

<p>It has not the grandeur of the Rhône when
the spring freshets from the Jura and the
Swiss lakes have filled it to its banks; it has
not the burning activity of the Seine as it bears
its thousands of boat-loads of produce and
merchandise to and from the Paris market;
it has not the prettiness of the Thames, nor
the legendary aspect of the Rhine; but in a
way it combines something of the features of
all, and has, in addition, a tone that is all its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span>
own, as it sweeps along through its countless
miles of ample curves, and holds within its
embrace all that is best of mediæval and Renaissance
France, the period which built up
the later monarchy and, who shall not say, the
present prosperous republic.</p>

<p>Throughout most of the river's course, one
sees, stretching to the horizon, row upon row
of staked vineyards with fruit and leaves in
luxuriant abundance and of all rainbow colours.
The peasant here, the worker in the
vineyards, is a picturesque element. He is not
particularly brilliant in colouring, but he is
usually joyous, and he invariably lives in a
well-kept and brilliantly environed habitation
and has an air of content and prosperity amid
the well-beloved treasures of his household.</p>


<p>The Loire is essentially a river of other
days. Truly, as Mr. James has said, "It is
the very model of a generous, beneficent
stream ... a wide river which you may follow
by a wide road is excellent company."</p>


<p>The Frenchman himself is more flowery:
"<i>C'est la plus noble rivière de France. Son
domaine est immense et magnifique.</i>"</p>

<p>The Loire is the longest river in France, and
the only one of the four great rivers whose
basin or watershed lies wholly within French<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span>
territory. It moreover traverses eleven provinces.
It rises in a fissure of granite rock at
the foot of the Gerbier-de-Jonc, a volcanic cone
in the mountains of the Vivarais, a hundred
kilometres or more south of Lyons. In three
kilometres, approximately two miles, the little
torrent drops a thousand feet, after receiving
to its arms a tiny affluent coming from the
Croix de Monteuse.</p>

<p>For twelve kilometres the river twists and
turns around the base of the Vivarais mountains,
and finally enters a gorge between the
rocks, and mingles with the waters of the little
Lac d'Issarles, entering for the first time a
flat lowland plain like that through which its
course mostly runs.</p>

<p>The monument-crowned pinnacles of Le Puy
and the inverted bowl of Puy-de-Dôme rise high
above the plain and point the way to Roanne,
where such activity as does actually take place
upon the Loire begins.</p>

<p>Navigation, classed officially as "<i>flottable</i>,"
merely, has already begun at Vorey, just below
Le Puy, but the traffic is insignificant.</p>

<p>Meantime the streams coming from the direction
of St. Etienne and Lyons have been
added to the Loire, but they do not much
increase its bulk. St. Galmier, the <i>source</i> dear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span>
to patrons of <i>tables d'hôte</i> on account of its
palatable mineral water, which is about the
only decent drinking-water one can buy at a
reasonable price, lies but a short distance away
to the right.</p>

<p>At St. Rambert the plain of Forez is entered,
and here the stream is enriched by numberless
rivulets which make their way from various
sources through a thickly wooded country.</p>

<p>From Roanne onward, the <i>Canal Latéral</i>
keeps company with the Loire to Chatillon, not
far from Orléans.</p>

<p>Before reaching Nevers, the <i>Canal du Nivernais</i>
branches off to the left and joins the Loire
with the Yonne at Auxerre. Daudet tells of
the life of the <i>Canal du Nivernais</i>, in "La Belle
Nivernaise," in a manner too convincingly
graphic for any one else to attempt the task,
in fiction or out of it. Like the Tartarin books,
"La Belle Nivernaise" is distinctly local, and
forms of itself an excellent guide to a little
known and little visited region.</p>

<p>At Nevers the topography changes, or
rather, the characteristics of the life of the
country round about change, for the topography,
so far as its profile is concerned, remains
much the same for three-fourths the
length of this great river. Nevers, La Charité,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span>
Sancerre, Gien, and Cosne follow in quick succession,
all reminders of a historic past as vivid
as it was varied.</p>

<p>From the heights of Sancerre one sees a
wonderful history-making panorama before
him. Cæsar crossed the Loire at Gien, the
Franks forded the river at La Charité, when
they first went against Aquitaine, and Charles
the Bald came sadly to grief on a certain
occasion at Pouilly.</p>

<p>It is here that the Loire rises to its greatest
flood, and hundreds of times, so history tells,
from 490 to 1866, the fickle river has caused
a devastation so great and terrible that the
memory of it is not yet dead.</p>

<p>This hardly seems possible of this usually
tranquil stream, and there have always been
scoffers.</p>

<p>Madame de Sévigné wrote in 1675 to M. de
Coulanges (but in her case perhaps it was mere
well-wishing), "<i>La belle Loire, elle est un peu
sujette à se déborder, mais elle en est plus
douce</i>."</p>

<p>Ancient writers were wont to consider the
inundations of the Loire as a punishment from
Heaven, and even in later times the superstition&mdash;if
it was a superstition&mdash;still remained.</p>

<div class="figright">
<img src="images/illus039_small.jpg" alt="The Loire near La Charité" title="The Loire near La Charité" />
<div class="caption"><i><a href="images/illus039.jpg">The Loire near La Charité</a></i></div>
</div>


<p>In 1825, when thousands of charcoal-burners<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span>
(<i>charbonniers</i>) were all but ruined, they petitioned
the government for assistance. The
official who had the matter in charge, and whose
name&mdash;fortunately for his fame&mdash;does not
appear to have been recorded, replied simply
that the flood was a periodical condition of
affairs which the Almighty brought about as
occasion demanded, with good cause, and for
this reason he refused all assistance.</p>

<p>Important public works have done much to
prevent repetitions of these inundations, but
the danger still exists, and always, in a wet
season, there are those dwellers along the river's
banks who fear the rising flood as they
would the plague.</p>

<p>Chatillon, with its towers; Gien, a busy hive
of industry, though with a historic past; Sully;
and St. Benoit-sur-Loire, with its unique double
transepted church; all pass in rapid review,
and one enters the ancient capital of the Orléannais
quite ready for the new chapter which,
in colouring, is to be so different from that
devoted to the upper valley.</p>

<p>From Orléans, south, one passes through a
veritable wonderland of fascinating charms.
Châteaux, monasteries, and great civic and
ecclesiastical monuments pass quickly in turn.</p>

<p>Then comes Touraine which all love, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span>
river meantime having grown no more swift
or ample, nor any more sluggish or attenuated.
It is simply the same characteristic flow which
one has known before.</p>

<p>The landscape only is changing, while the
fruits and flowers, and the trees and foliage
are more luxuriant, and the great châteaux are
more numerous, splendid, and imposing.</p>

<p>Of his well-beloved Touraine, Balzac wrote:
"Do not ask me <i>why</i> I love Touraine; I love
it not merely as one loves the cradle of his
birth, nor as one loves an oasis in a desert,
but as an artist loves his art."</p>

<p>Blois, with its bloody memories; Chaumont,
splendid and retired; Chambord, magnificent,
pompous, and bare; Amboise, with its great
tower high above the river, follow in turn till
the Loire makes its regal entrée into Tours.
"What a spectacle it is," wrote Sterne in
"Tristram Shandy," "for a traveller who
journeys through Touraine at the time of the
vintage."</p>

<p>And then comes the final step which brings
the traveller to where the limpid waters of the
Loire mingle with the salty ocean, and what
a triumphant meeting it is!</p>

<div class="figright">

<div class="caption"><a href="images/illus043.jpg"><i>Coiffes of Amboise and Orléans</i></a></div>
</div>

<p>Most of the cities of the Loire possess but
one bridge, but Tours has three, and, as be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span>comes
a great provincial capital, sits enthroned
upon the river-bank in mighty splendour.</p>

<p>The feudal towers of the Château de Luynes
are almost opposite, and Cinq-Mars, with its
pagan "<i>pile</i>" and the ruins of its feudal castle
high upon a hill, points the way down-stream
like a mariner's beacon. Langeais follows, and
the Indre, the Cher, and the Vienne, all ample
and historic rivers, go to swell the flood which
passes under the bridges of Saumur, Ancenis,
and Ponts de Cé.</p>

<p>From Tours to the ocean, the Loire comes to
its greatest amplitude, though even then, in
spite of its breadth, it is, for the greater part
of the year, impotent as to the functions of a
great river.</p>

<p>Below Angers the Loire receives its first
great affluent coming from the country lying
back of the right bank: the Maine itself is a
considerable river. It rises far up in the
Breton peninsula, and before it empties itself
into the Loire, it has been aggrandized by
three great tributaries, the Loir, the Sarthe,
and the Mayenne.</p>

<p>Here in this backwater of the Loire, as
one might call it, is as wonderful a collection of
natural beauties and historical châteaux as on
the Loire itself. Châteaudun, Mayenne, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span>
Vendôme are historic ground of superlative
interest, and the great castle at Châteaudun
is as magnificent in its way as any of the monuments
of the Loire. Vendôme has a Hôtel de
Ville which is an admirable relic of a feudal
edifice, and the <i>clocher</i> of its church, which
dominates many square leagues of country,
is counted as one of the most perfectly disposed
church spires in existence, as lovely, almost,
as Texier's masterwork at Chartres, or
the needle-like <i>flêches</i> at Strasburg or Freiburg
in Breisgau.</p>

<p>The Maine joins the Loire just below Angers,
at a little village significantly called La Pointe.
Below La Pointe are St. Georges-sur-Loire,
and three <i>châteaux de commerce</i> which give
their names to the three principal Angevin
vineyards: Château Serrand, l'Epinay, and
Chevigné.</p>

<p>Vineyard after vineyard, and château after
château follow rapidly, until one reaches the
Ponts de Cé with their <i>petite ville</i>,&mdash;all very
delightful. Not so the bridge at Ancenis, where
the flow of water is marked daily on a huge
black and white scale. The bridge is quite the
ugliest wire-rope affair to be seen on the Loire,
and one is only too glad to leave it behind,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span>
though it is with a real regret that he parts
from Ancenis itself.</p>

<p>Some years ago one could go from Angers
to St. Nazaire by boat. It must have been a
magnificent trip, extraordinarily calm and serene,
amid an abundance of picturesque details;
old châteaux and bridges in strong contrast
to the prairies of Touraine and the Orléannais.
One embarked at the foot of the
stupendously towered château of King René,
and for a <i>petite heure</i> navigated the Maine
in the midst of great <i>chalands</i>, fussy little
<i>remorqueurs</i> and <i>barques</i> until La Pointe
was reached, when the Loire was followed to
Nantes and St. Nazaire.</p>

<p>To-day this fine trip is denied one, the boats
going only so far as La Pointe.</p>

<p>Below Angers the Loire flows around and
about a veritable archipelago of islands and
islets, cultivated with all the luxuriance of a
back-yard garden, and dotted with tiny hamlets
of folk who are supremely happy and content
with their lot.</p>

<p>Some currents which run behind the islands
are swift flowing and impetuous, while others
are practically elongated lakes, as dead as
those <i>lômes</i> which in certain places flank the
Saône and the Rhône.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span></p>

<p>All these various branches are united as the
Loire flows between the piers of the ungainly
bridge of the Chemin-de-fer de Niort as it
crosses the river at Chalonnes.</p>

<p>Champtocé and Montjean follow, each with
an individuality all its own. Here the commerce
takes on an increased activity, thanks
to the great national waterway known as the
"Canal de Brest à Nantes." Here at the busy
port of Montjean&mdash;which the Angevins still
spell and pronounce <i>Montéjean</i>&mdash;the Loire
takes on a breadth and grandeur similar to the
great rivers in the western part of America.
Montjean is dominated by a fine ogival church,
with a battery of arcs-boutants which are a
joy in themselves.</p>

<p>On the other bank, lying back of a great
plain, which stretches away from the river itself,
is Champtocé, pleasantly situated on the
flank of a hill and dominated by the ruins of a
thirteenth-century château which belonged to
the cruel Gilles de Retz, somewhat apocryphally
known to history as "Barbe-bleu"&mdash;not
the Bluebeard of the nursery tale, who was
of Eastern origin, but a sort of Occidental successor
who was equally cruel and bloodthirsty
in his attitude toward his whilom wives.</p>

<p>From this point on one comes within the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span>
sphere of influence of Nantes, and there is
more or less of a suburban traffic on the railway,
and the plodders cityward by road are
more numerous than the mere vagabonds of
the countryside.</p>

<p>The peasant women whom one meets wear a
curious bonnet, set on the head well to the fore,
with wings at the side folded back quite like
the pictures that one sees of the mediæval
dames of these parts, a survival indeed of the
middle ages.</p>

<p>The Loire becomes more and more animated
and occasionally there is a great tow of boats
like those that one sees continually passing on
the lower Seine. Here the course of the Loire
takes on a singular aspect. It is filled with
long flat islands, sometimes in archipelagos, but
often only a great flat prairie surrounded by a
tranquil canal, wide and deep, and with little
resemblance to the mistress Loire of a hundred
or two kilometres up-stream. All these isles
are in a high state of cultivation, though wholly
worked with the hoe and the spade, both of
them of a primitiveness that might have come
down from Bible times; rare it is to see a
horse or a harrow on these "bouquets of verdure
surrounded by waves."</p>

<p>Near Oudon is one of those monumental<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span>
follies which one comes across now and then
in most foreign countries: a great edifice
which serves no useful purpose, and which,
were it not for certain redeeming features,
would be a sorry thing indeed. The "Folie-Siffait,"
a citadel which perches itself high
upon the summit of a hill, was&mdash;and is&mdash;an
<i>amusette</i> built by a public-spirited man of
Nantes in order that his workmen might have
something to do in a time of a scarcity of work.
It is a bizarre, incredible thing, but the motive
which inspired its erection was most worthy,
and the roadway running beneath, piercing its
foundation walls, gives a theatrical effect
which, in a way, makes it the picturesque rival
of many a more famous Rhine castle.</p>

<p>The river valley widens out here at Oudon,
practically the frontier of Bretagne and Anjou.
The railroad pierces the rock walls of the river
with numerous tunnels along the right bank,
and the Vendean country stretches far to the
southward in long rolling hills quite unlike
any of the characteristics of other parts of
the valley. Finally, the vast plain of Mauves
comes into sight, beautifully coloured with a
white and iron-stained rocky background which
is startlingly picturesque in its way, if not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span>
wholly beautiful according to the majority of
standards.</p>

<p>Next comes what a Frenchman has called a
"tumultuous vision of Nantes." To-day the
very ancient and historic city which grew up
from the Portus Namnetum and the Condivicnum
of the Romans is indeed a veritable
tumult of chimneys, masts, and locomotives.
But all this will not detract one jot from its
reputation of being one of the most delightful
of provincial capitals, and the smoke and activity
of its port only tend to accentuate a note
of colour that in the whole itinerary of the
Loire has been but pale.</p>

<p>Below Nantes the Loire estuary has turned
the surrounding country into a little Holland,
where fisherfolk and their boats, with sails of
red and blue, form charming symphonies of
pale colour. In the <i>cabarets</i> along its shores
there is a strange medley of peasants, sea-farers,
and fisher men and women. Not so cosmopolitan
a crew as one sees in the harbourside
<i>cabarets</i> at Marseilles, or even Le Havre,
but sufficiently strange to be a fascination to
one who has just come down from the headwaters.</p>

<p>The "Section Maritime," from Nantes to
the sea, is a matter of some sixty kilometres.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span>
Here the boats increase in number and size.
They are known as <i>gabares</i>, <i>chalands</i>, and <i>alléges</i>,
and go down with the river-current and
return on the incoming ebb, for here the river
is tidal.</p>

<p>Gray and green is the aspect at the Loire's
source, and green and gray it still is, though
of a decidedly different colour-value, at St.
Nazaire, below Nantes, the real deep-water
port of the Loire.</p>

<p>By this time the river has amplified into a
broad estuary which is lost in the incoming
and outgoing tides of the Bay of Biscay.</p>

<p>For nearly a thousand kilometres the Loire
has wound its way gently and broadly through
rocky escarpments, fertile plains, populous and
luxurious towns,&mdash;all of it historic ground,&mdash;by
stately châteaux and through vineyards
and fruit orchards, with a placid grandeur.</p>

<p>Now it becomes more or less prosaic and
matter-of-fact, though in a way no less interesting,
as it takes on some of the attributes
of the outside world.</p>

<p>This outline, then, approximates somewhat
a portrait of the Loire. It is the result of
many pilgrimages enthusiastically undertaken;
a long contemplation of the charms of perhaps<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span>
the most beautiful river in France, from its
source to its mouth, at all seasons of the year.</p>

<p>The riches and curios of the cities along its
banks have been contemplated with pleasure,
intermingled with a memory of many stirring
scenes of the past, but it is its châteaux that
make it famous.</p>

<p>The story of the châteaux has been told before
in hundreds of volumes, but only a personal
view of them will bring home to one the
manners and customs of one of the most luxurious
periods of life in the France of other
days.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER II.<span class="pagenum"><a href="#Contents">To ToC</a></span></h2>

<h4>THE ORLÉANNAIS</h4>


<p>Of the many travelled English and Americans
who go to Paris, how few visit the Loire
valley with its glorious array of mediæval and
Renaissance châteaux. No part of France, except
Paris, is so accessible, and none is so comfortably
travelled, whether by road or by rail.</p>

<p>At Orleans one is at the very gateway of
this splendid, bountiful region, the lower valley
of the Loire. Here the river first takes
on a complexion which previously it had
lacked, for it is only when the Loire becomes
the boundary-line between the north and the
south that one comes to realize its full importance.</p>

<p>The Orléannais, like many another province
of mid-France, is a region where plenty awaits
rich and poor alike. Not wholly given over to
agriculture, nor yet wholly to manufacturing,
it is without that restless activity of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span>
frankly industrial centres of the north. In
spite of this, though, the Orléannais is not
idle.</p>


<div class="figleft">
<a href="images/map-02.jpg">
<img src="images/map-02_small.jpg" alt="The Châteaux of the Loire (Map)" title="The Châteaux of the Loire (Map)" /></a>
</div>

<p>Orleans is the obvious <i>pointe de départ</i> for
all the wonderland of the Renaissance which
is to follow, but itself and its immediate surroundings
have not the importance for the
visitor, in spite of the vivid historical chapters
which have been written here in the past, that
many another less famous city possesses. By
this is meant that the existing monuments of
history are by no means as numerous or splendid
here as one might suppose. Not that they
are entirely lacking, but rather that they are
of a different species altogether from that
array of magnificently planned châteaux which
line the banks of the Loire below.</p>

<p>To one coming from the north the entrance
to the Orléannais will be emphatically marked.
It is the first experience of an atmosphere
which, if not characteristically or climatically
of the south, is at least reminiscent thereof,
with a luminosity which the provinces of old
France farther north entirely lack.</p>

<p>As Lavedan, the Académicien, says: "Here
all focuses itself into one great picture, the
combined romance of an epoch. Have you not
been struck with a land where the clouds, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span>
atmosphere, the odour of the soil, and the
breezes from afar, all comport, one with another,
in true and just proportions?" This is
the Orléannais, a land where was witnessed the
morning of the Valois, the full noon of Louis
XIV., and the twilight of Louis XVI.</p>

<p>The Orléannais formed a distinct part of
mediæval France, as it did, ages before, of
western Gaul. Of all the provinces through
which the Loire flows, the Orléannais is as prolific
as any of great names and greater events,
and its historical monuments, if not so splendid
as those in Touraine, are no less rare.</p>

<p>Orleans itself contains many remarkable
Gothic and Renaissance constructions, and not
far away is the ancient church of the old abbey
of Notre Dame de Cléry, one of the most historic
and celebrated shrines in the time of the
superstitious Louis XI.; while innumerable
mediæval villes and ruined fortresses plentifully
besprinkle the province.</p>

<p>One characteristic possessed by the Orléannais
differentiates it from the other outlying
provinces of the old monarchy. The people
and the manners and customs of this great and
important duchy were allied, in nearly all
things, with the interests and events of the
capital itself, and so there was always a lack<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a></span>
of individuality, which even to-day is noticeably
apparent in the Orleans capital. The
shops, hotels, cafés, and the people themselves
might well be one of the <i>quartiers</i> of Paris, so
like are they in general aspect.</p>

<p>The notable Parisian character of the inhabitants
of Orleans, and the resemblance of
the people of the surrounding country to those
of the Ile of France, is due principally to the
fact that the Orléannais was never so isolated
as many others of the ancient provinces. It
was virtually a neighbour of the capital, and its
relations with it were intimate and numerous.
Moreover, it was favoured by a great number
of lines of communication by road and by
water, so that its manners and customs became,
more or less unconsciously, interpolations.</p>

<p>The great event of the year in Orleans is the
Fête de Jeanne d'Arc, which takes place in the
month of May. Usually few English and
American visitors are present, though why it
is hard to reason out, for it takes place at
quite the most delightful season in the year.
Perhaps it is because Anglo-Saxons are
ashamed of the part played by their ancestors
in the shocking death of the maid of Domremy
and Orleans. Innumerable are the relics and
reminders of the "Maid" scattered through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span>out
the town, and the local booksellers have
likewise innumerable and authoritative accounts
of the various episodes of her life, which
saves the necessity of making further mention
here.</p>

<p>There are several statues of Jeanne d'Arc
in the city, and they have given rise to the following
account written by Jules Lemaitre, the
Académicien:</p>

<p>"I believe that the history of Jeanne d'Arc
was the first that was ever told to me (before
even the fairy-tales of Perrault). The 'Mort
de Jeanne d'Arc,' of Casimir Delavigne, was
the first fable that I learned, and the equestrian
statue of the 'Maid,' in the Place Martroi,
at Orleans, is perhaps the oldest vision
that my memory guards.</p>

<p>"This statue of Jeanne d'Arc is absurd.
She has a Grecian profile, and a charger which
is not a war-horse but a race-horse. Nevertheless
to me it was noble and imposing.</p>

<p>"In the courtyard of the Hôtel de Ville is a
<i>petite pucelle</i>, very gentle and pious, who holds
against her heart her sword, after the manner
of a crucifix. At the end of the bridge across
the Loire is another Jeanne d'Arc, as the maid
of war, surrounded by swirling draperies, as
in a picture of Juvenet's. This to me tells the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a></span>
whole story of the reverence with which the
martyred 'Maid' is regarded in the city of
Orleans by the Loire."</p>

<p>One can appreciate all this, and to the full,
for a Frenchman is a stern critic of art, even
that of his own countrymen, and Jeanne d'Arc,
along with some other celebrities, is one of
those historical figures which have seldom had
justice done them in sculptured or pictorial
representations. The best, perhaps, is the precocious
Lepage's fine painting, now in America.
What would not the French give for the return
of this work of art?</p>

<p>The Orléannais, with the Ile de France,
formed the particular domain of the third race
of French monarchs. From 1364 to 1498 the
province was an appanage known as the Duché
d'Orleans, but it was united with the Crown
by Louis XII., and finally divided into the Departments
of Loir et Cher, Eure et Loir, and
Loiret.</p>

<p>Like the "pardons" and "benedictions"
of Finistère and other parts of Bretagne, the
peasants of the Loiret have a quaint custom
which bespeaks a long handed-down superstition.
On the first Sunday of Lent they hie
themselves to the fields with lighted fagots
and chanting the following lines:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<span class="i0_5">"Sortez, sortez d'ici mulots!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Où je vais vous brûler les crocs!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Quittez, quittez ces blés;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Allez, vous trouverez<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dans la cave du curé<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Plus à boire qu' à manger."<br /></span>
</div></div>


<p>Just how far the curé endorses these sentiments,
the author of this book does not know.
The explanation of the rather extraordinary
proceeding came from one of the participants,
who, having played his part in the ceremony,
dictated the above lines over sundry <i>petits
verres</i> paid for by the writer. The day is not
wound up, however, with an orgy of eating and
drinking, as is sometimes the case in far-western
Brittany. The peasant of the Loiret simply
eats rather heavily of "<i>mi</i>," which is
nothing more or less than oatmeal porridge,
after which he goes to bed.</p>

<p>The Loire rolls down through the Orléannais,
from Châteauneuf-sur-Loire and Jargeau,
and cuts the banks of <i>sable</i>, and the very shores
themselves, into little capes and bays which
are delightful in their eccentricity. Here cuts
in the <i>Canal d'Orleans</i>, which makes possible
the little traffic that goes on between the Seine
and the Loire.</p>

<p>A few kilometres away from the right bank
of the Loire, in the heart of the Gatanais, is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a></span>
Lorris, the home of Guillaume de Lorris, the
first author of the "Roman de la Rose." For
this reason alone it should become a literary
shrine of the very first rank, though, in spite
of its claim, no one ever heard of a literary
pilgrim making his way there.</p>

<p>Lorris is simply a big, overgrown French
market-town, which is delightful enough in its
somnolence, but which lacks most of the attributes
which tourists in general seem to demand.</p>

<p>At Lorris a most momentous treaty was
signed, known as the "Paix de Lorris,"
wherein was assured to the posterity of St.
Louis the heritage of the Comte de Toulouse,
another of those periodical territorial aggrandizements
which ultimately welded the
French nation into the whole that it is to-day.</p>

<p>From the juncture of the <i>Canal d'Orleans</i>
with the Loire one sees shining in the brilliant
sunlight the roof-tops of Orleans, the Aurelianum
of the Romans, its hybrid cathedral overtopping
all else. It was Victor Hugo who said
of this cathedral: "This odious church, which
from afar holds so much of promise, and which
near by has none," and Hugo undoubtedly
spoke the truth.</p>

<p>Orleans is an old city and a <i>cité neuve</i>.
Where the river laps its quays, it is old but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span>
commonplace; back from the river is a strata
which is really old, fine Gothic house-fronts
and old leaning walls; while still farther from
the river, as one approaches the railway station,
it is strictly modern, with all the devices
and appliances of the newest of the new.</p>

<p>The Orleans of history lies riverwards,&mdash;the
Orleans where the heart of France pulsed
itself again into life in the tragic days which
were glorified by "the Maid."</p>

<p>"The countryside of the Orléannais has the
monotony of a desert," said an English traveller
some generations ago. He was wrong.
To do him justice, however, or to do his observations
justice, he meant, probably, that,
save the river-bottom of the Loire, the great
plain which begins with La Beauce and ends
with the Sologne has a comparatively uninteresting
topography. This is true; but it is not a
desert. La Beauce is the best grain-growing
region in all France, and the Sologne is now a
reclaimed land whose sandy soil has proved
admirably adapted to an unusually abundant
growth of the vine. So much for this old-time
point of view, which to-day has changed considerably.</p>

<p>The Orléannais is one of the most populous
and progressive sections of all France, and its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span>
inhabitants, per square kilometre, are constantly
increasing in numbers, which is more
than can be said of every <i>département</i>. There
are multitudes of tiny villages, and one is
scarcely ever out of sight and sound of a habitation.</p>

<div class="figright"><a href="images/illus065.jpg">
<img src="images/illus065_small.jpg" alt="Environs of Orleans (Map)" title="Environs of Orleans (Map)" />
</a>
</div>


<p>In the great forest, just to the west of Orleans,
are two small villages, each a celebrated
battle-ground, and a place of a patriotic pil<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span>grimage
on the eighth and ninth of November
of each year. They are Coulmiers and Bacon,
and here some fugitives from Metz and Sedan,
with some young troops exposed to fire for the
first time, engaged with the Prussians (in
1870) who had occupied Orleans since mid-October.
There is the usual conventional "soldiers'
monument,"&mdash;with considerably more
art about it than is usually seen in America,&mdash;before
which Frenchmen seemingly never
cease to worship.</p>

<p>This same <i>Forêt d'Orleans</i>, one of those wild-woods
which so plentifully besprinkle France,
has a sad and doleful memory in the traditions
of the druidical inhabitants of a former
day. Their practices here did not differ
greatly from those of their brethren elsewhere,
but local history is full of references to atrocities
so bloodthirsty that it is difficult to believe
that they were ever perpetrated under
the guise of religion.</p>

<p>Surrounding the forest are many villages
and hamlets, war-stricken all in the dark days
of seventy-one, when the Prussians were overrunning
the land.</p>

<p>Of all the cities of the Loire, Orleans, Blois,
Tours, Angers, and Nantes alone show any
spirit of modern progressiveness or of likeness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span>
to the capital. The rest, to all appearances,
are dead, or at least sleeping in their pasts.
But they are charming and restful spots for
all that, where in melancholy silence sit the old
men, while the younger folk, including the very
children, are all at work in the neighbouring
vineyards or in the wheat-fields of La Beauce.</p>

<p>Meung-sur-Loire and Beaugency sleep on the
river-bank, their proud monuments rising high
in the background,&mdash;the massive tower of
Cæsar and a quartette of church spires. Just
below Orleans is the juncture of the Loiret and
the Loire at St. Mesmin, while only a few kilometres
away is Cléry, famed for its associations
of Louis XI.</p>

<p>The Loiret is not a very ample river, and is
classed by the Minister of Public Works as navigable
for but four kilometres of its length.
This, better than anything else, should define
its relative importance among the great waterways
of France. Navigation, as it is known
elsewhere, is practically non-existent.</p>

<p>The course of the Loiret is perhaps twelve
kilometres all told, but it has given its name
to a great French <i>département</i>, though it is
doubtless the shortest of all the rivers of
France thus honoured.</p>

<p>It first comes to light in the dainty park of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span>
the Château de la Source, where there are two
distinct sources. The first forms a small circular
basin, known as the "Bouillon," which
leads into another semicircular basin called the
"Bassin du Miroir," from the fact that it
reflects the façade of the château in its placid
surface. Of course, this is all very artificial
and theatrical, but it is a pretty conceit nevertheless.
The other source, known as the
"Grande Source," joins the rivulet some hundreds
of yards below the "Bassin du Miroir."</p>

<p>The Château de la Source is a seventeenth-century
edifice, of no great architectural beauty
in itself, but sufficiently sylvan in its surroundings
to give it rank as one of the notable places
of pilgrimage for tourists who, said a cynical
French writer, "take the châteaux of the Loire
<i>tour à tour</i> as they do the morgue, the Moulin
Rouge, and the sewers of Paris."</p>

<p>In the early days the château belonged to the
Cardinal Briçonnet, and it was here that Bolingbroke,
after having been stripped of his
titles in England, went into retirement in 1720.
In 1722 he received Voltaire, who read him his
"Henriade."</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/illus069_small.jpg" alt="The Loiret" title="The Loiret" />
<div class="caption"><a href="images/illus069.jpg"><i>The Loiret</i></a></div>
</div>

<p>In 1815 the invading Prince Eckmühl, with
his staff, installed himself in the château, when,
after Waterloo, the Prussian and French ar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span>mies
were separated only by a barrier placed
midway on the bridge at Orleans. It was here
also that the Prussian army was disbanded, on
the agreement of the council held at Angerville,
near Orleans.</p>

<p>There are three other châteaux on the borders
of the Loiret, which are of more than
ordinary interest, so far as great country
houses and their surroundings go, though their
histories are not very striking, with perhaps
the exception of the Château de la Fontaine,
which has a remarkable garden, laid out by
Lenôtre, the designer of the parks at Versailles.</p>

<p>Leaving Orleans by the right bank of the
Loire, one first comes to La Chapelle-St. Mesmin.
La Chapelle has a church dating from
the eleventh century and a château which is
to-day the <i>maison de campagne</i> of the Bishop
of Orleans. On the opposite bank was the
Abbaye de Micy, founded by Clovis at the time
of his conversion. A stone cross, only, marks
the site to-day.</p>

<p>St. Ay follows next, and is usually set down
in the guide-books as "celebrated for good
wines." This is not to be denied for a moment,
and it is curious to note that the city bears the
same name as the famous town in the cham<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span>pagne
district, celebrated also for good wine,
though of a different kind. The name of the
Orléannais Ay is gained from a hermitage
founded here by a holy man, who died in the
sixth century. His tomb was discovered in
1860, under the choir of the church, which
makes it a place of pilgrimage of no little local
importance.</p>

<p>At Meung-sur-Loire one should cross the
river to Cléry, five kilometres off, seldom if
ever visited by casual travellers. But why?
Simply because it is overlooked in that universal
haste shown by most travellers&mdash;who
are not students of art or architecture, or deep
lovers of history&mdash;in making their way to
more popular shrines. One will not regret the
time taken to visit Cléry, which shared with
Our Lady of Embrun the devotions of Louis XI.</p>

<p>Cléry's three thousand pastoral inhabitants
of to-day would never give it distinction, and
it is only the Maison de Louis XI. and the
Basilique de Notre Dame which makes it worth
while, but this is enough.</p>

<p>In "Quentin Durward" one reads of the
time when the superstitious Louis was held in
captivity by the Burgundian, Charles the Bold,
and of how the French king made his devotions
before the little image, worn in his hat, of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span>
Virgin of Cléry; "the grossness of his superstition,
none the less than his fickleness, leading
him to believe Our Lady of Cléry to be quite
a different person from the other object of his
devotion, the Madonna of Embrun, a tiny
mountain village in southwestern France.</p>

<p>"'Sweet Lady of Cléry,' he exclaimed, clasping
his hands and beating his breast as he
spoke, 'Blessed Mother of Mercy! thou who
art omnipotent with omnipotence, have compassion
with me, a sinner! It is true I have sometimes
neglected you for thy blessed sister of
Embrun; but I am a king, my power is great,
my wealth boundless; and were it otherwise,
I would double my <i>gabelle</i> on my subjects
rather than not pay my debts to you both.'"</p>

<p>Louis endowed the church at Cléry, and the
edifice was built in the fine flamboyant style
of the period, just previous to his death, which
De Commines gives as "<i>le samedy pénultième
jour d'Aoust, l'an mil quatre cens quatre-vingtz
et trois, à huit heures du soir</i>."</p>

<p>Louis XI. was buried here, and the chief
"sight" is of course his tomb, beside which
is a flagstone which covers the heart of
Charles VIII. The Chapelle St. Jacques,
within the church, is ornamented by a series
of charming sculptures, and the Chapelle des<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span>
Dunois-Longueville holds the remains of the
famous ally of Jeanne d'Arc and members of
his family.</p>

<p>In the choir is the massive oaken statue of
Our Lady of Cléry (thirteenth century); the
very one before which Louis made his vows.
There is some old glass in the choir and a
series of sculptured stalls, which would make
famous a more visited and better known shrine.
There is a fine sculptured stone portal to the
sacristy, and within there are some magnificent
old <i>armoires</i>, and also two chasubles, which
saw service in some great church, perhaps here,
in the times of Louis himself.</p>

<p>The "Maison de Louis XI.," near the
church, is a house of brick, restored in 1651,
and now&mdash;or until a very recent date&mdash;occupied
by a community of nuns. In the Grande
Rue is another "Maison de Louis XI.;" at
least it has his cipher on the painted ceiling.
It is now occupied by the Hôtel de la Belle
Image. Those who like to dine and sleep where
have also dined and slept royal heads will appreciate
putting up at this hostelry.</p>

<div class="figright">
<img src="images/illus075_small.jpg" alt="The Loire at Meung" title="The Loire at Meung" />
<div class="caption"><i><a href="images/illus075.jpg">The Loire at Meung</a></i></div>
</div>


<p>Meung-sur-Loire was the birthplace of Jehan
Clopinel, better known as Jean de Meung, who
continued Guillaume de Lorris's "Roman de la
Rose," the most famous bit of verse produced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span>
by the <i>trouvères</i> of the thirteenth century.
The voice of the troubadour was soon after
hushed for ever, but that thirteenth-century
masterwork&mdash;though by two hands and the
respective portions unequal in merit&mdash;lives
for ever as the greatest of its kind. In memory
of the author, Meung has its Rue Jehan de
Meung, for want of a more effective or appealing
monument.</p>

<p>Dumas opens the history of "Les Trois
Mousquétaires" with the following brilliantly
romantic lines anent Meung: "<i>Le premier lundi
du mois d'Avril, 1625, le bourg de Meung, où
naquit l'auteur du 'Roman de la Rose.'</i>"
(One of the authors, he should have said, but
here is where Dumas nodded, as he frequently
did.)</p>

<p>Continuing, one reads: "The town was in
a veritable uproar. It was as if the Huguenots
were up in arms and the drama of a second
Rochelle was being enacted." Really the description
is too brilliant and entrancing to be
repeated here, and if any one has forgotten
his Dumas to the extent that he has forgotten
D'Artagnan's introduction to the hostelry of
the "Franc Meunier," he is respectfully referred
back to that perennially delightful romance.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span></p>

<p>Meung was once a Roman fortress, known
as Maudunum, and in the eleventh century St.
Liphard founded a monastery here.</p>

<p>In the fifteenth century Meung was the
prison of François Villon. Poor vagabond as
he was then, it has become the fashion to laud
both the personality and the poesy of Maître
François Villon.</p>

<p>By the orders of Thibaut d'Aussigny, Bishop
of Orleans, Villon was confined in a strong
tower attached to the side of the <i>clocher</i> of the
parish church of St. Liphard, and which adjoined
the <i>château de plaisance</i> belonging to
the bishop. Primarily this imprisonment was
due to a robbery in which the poet had been
concerned at Orleans. He spent the whole of
the summer in this dungeon, which was overrun
with rats, and into which he had to be lowered
by ropes. As his food consisted of bread
and water only, his sufferings at this time were
probably greater than at any other period in
his life. Here the burglar-poet remained until
October, 1461, when Louis XI. visited Meung,
and, to mark the occasion, ordered the release
of all prisoners. For this delivery, Villon, according
to the accounts of his life, appears to
have been genuinely grateful to the king.</p>

<p>At Beaugency, seven kilometres from Meung,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">49</a></span>
one comes upon an architectural and historical
treat which is unexpected.</p>

<p>In the eleventh century Beaugency was a fief
of the bishopric of Amiens, and its once strong
château was occupied by the Barons de Landry,
the last of whom died, without children, in the
thirteenth century. Philippe-le-Bel bought the
fief and united it with the Comté de Blois. It
was made an independent <i>comté</i> of itself in
1569, and in 1663 became definitely an appanage
of Orleans. The Prince de Galles took Beaugency
in 1359, the Gascons in 1361, Duguesclin
in 1370 and again in 1417; in 1421 and in 1428
it was taken by the English, from whom it was
delivered by Jeanne d'Arc in 1429. Internal
wars and warfares continued for another hundred
and fifty years, finally culminating in one
of the grossest scenes which had been enacted
within its walls,&mdash;the bloody revenge against
the Protestants, encouraged doubtless by the
affair of St. Bartholomew's night at Paris.</p>

<p>The ancient square donjon of the eleventh
century, known as the Tour de César, still
looms high above the town. It must be one of
the hugest keeps in all France. The old château
of the Dunois is now a charitable institution,
but reflects, in a way, the splendour of
its fourteenth-century inception, and its Salle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a></span>
de Jeanne d'Arc, with its great chimneypiece,
is worthy to rank with the best of its kind along
the Loire. The spiral staircase, of which the
Loire builders were so fond, is admirable here,
and dates from 1530.</p>

<p>The Hôtel de Ville of Beaugency is a charming
edifice of the very best of Renaissance,
which many more pretentious structures of the
period are not. It dates from 1526, and was
entirely restored&mdash;not, however, to its detriment,
as frequently happens&mdash;in the last years
of the nineteenth century. Its charm, nevertheless,
lies mostly in its exterior, for little remains
of value within except a remarkable
series of old embroideries taken from the choir
of the old abbey of Beaugency.</p>

<p>The Église de Notre Dame is a Romanesque
structure with Gothic interpolations. It is not
bad in its way, but decidedly is not remarkable
as mediæval churches go.</p>

<p>The old streets of Beaugency contain a dazzling
array of old houses in wood and stone,
and in the Rue des Templiers is a rare example
of Romanesque civil architecture; at least
the type is rare enough in the Orléannais,
though more frequently seen in the south of
France. The Tour St. Firmin dates from 1530,
and is all that remains of a church which stood<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span>
here up to revolutionary times. The square
ruined towers known as the Porte Tavers are
relics of the city's old walls and gates, and are
all that are left to mark the ancient enclosure.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/illus081_small.jpg" alt="Beaugency" title="Beaugency" />
<div class="caption"><a href="images/illus081.jpg"><i>Beaugency</i></a></div>
</div>

<p>The Tour du Diable and the house of the
ruling abbot remain to suggest the power and
magnificence of the great abbey which was
built here in the tenth century. In 1567 it was
burned, and later restored, but beyond the two
features just mentioned there is nothing to
indicate its former uses, the remaining structures
having passed into private hands and
being devoted to secular uses.</p>

<p>The old bridge which crosses the Loire at
this point is most curious, and dates from various
epochs. It is 440 metres in length, and is
composed of twenty-six arches, one of which
dates from the fourteenth century, when
bridge-building was really an art. Eight of
the present-day arches are of wood, and on
the second is a monolith surmounted by a figure
of Christ in bronze, replacing a former chapel
to St. Jacques. A chapel on a bridge is not
a unique arrangement, but few exist to-day,
one of the most famous being, perhaps, that
on the ruined bridge of St. Bénezet at Avignon.</p>

<p>Altogether, Beaugency, as it sleeps its life
away after the strenuous days of the middle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span>
ages, is more lovable by far than a great metropolis.</p>

<p>The traveller is well repaid who makes a
stop at Beaugency a part of a three days' gentle
ramble among the usually neglected towns
and villages of the Orléannais and the Blaisois,
instead of rushing through to Blois by express-train,
which is what one usually does.</p>

<p>Southward one's route lies through pleasant
vineyards, on one side the Sologne, and on the
other the Coteau de Guignes, which latter ranks
as quite the best among the vine-growing districts
of the Orléannais.</p>

<p>Near Tavers is a natural curiosity in the
shape of the "Fontaine des Sables Mouvants,"
where the sands of a tiny spring boil and bubble
like a miniature geyser.</p>

<p>Mer, another small town, follows, twelve kilometres
farther on. Like Beaugency it is a somnolent
bourg, and the life of the peasant folk
round about, who go to market on one day at
Beaugency and on another at Blois, and occasionally
as far away as Orleans, is much the
same as it was a century ago.</p>

<p>There is a Boulevard de la Gare and a
Grande Rue at Mer, the latter leading to a fine
Gothic church with a fifteenth-century tower,
which is admirable in every way, and forms<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span>
a beacon by land for many miles around. The
primitive church at Mer dates from the eleventh
century, the side walls, however, being all
that remain of that period. There is a sculptured
pulpit of the seventeenth century, and a
great painting, which looks ancient and is certainly
a masterful work of art, representing
an "Adoration of the Magi."</p>

<p>When all is said and done, it is its irresistible
and inexpressible charm which makes Mer well-beloved,
rather than any great wealth of artistic
atmosphere of any nature.</p>

<p>Away to the south, across the Loire to
Muides, runs the route to Chambord, through
the Sologne, where immediately the whole aspect
of life changes from that on the borders
of the rich grain-lands of the Orléannais and
La Beauce.</p>

<p>All the way from Beaugency to Blois the
Loire threads its way through a lovely country,
whose rolling slopes, back from the river, are
surmounted here and there by windmills, a not
very frequent adjunct to the landscape of
France, except in the north.</p>

<p>Near Mer is Menars, with its eighteenth-century
château of La Pompadour; Suèvres, the
site of an ancient Roman city; the lowlands
lying before Chambord; St. Die; Montlivault;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span>
St. Claude, and a score of little villages which
are entrancing in their old-world aspect even
in these days of progress. This completes the
panorama to Blois which, with the Blaisois,
forms the borderland between the Orléannais
and Touraine.</p>

<p>Before reaching Blois, Menars, at any rate,
commands attention. It fronts upon the Loire,
but is practically upon the northern border of
the Forêt de Blois, hence properly belongs to
the Blaisois. Menars was made a rendezvous
for the chase by the wily and pleasure-loving
La Pompadour, who quartered herself at the
château, which afterward passed to her brother,
De Marigny.</p>

<p>Before the Revolution, Menars was the seat
of a marquisate, of which the land was bought
by Louis XV. for his famous, or infamous,
<i>maîtresse</i>. The property has frequently
changed hands since that day, but its gardens
and terraces, descending toward the river-bank,
mark it as one of those <i>coquette</i> establishments,
with which France was dotted in
the eighteenth century.</p>

<p>These establishments possessed enough of
luxurious appointments to be classed as fitting
for the butterflies of the time, but in no
way, so far as the architectural design or the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span>
artistic details were concerned, were any of

<h2>CHAPTER III.<span class="pagenum"><a href="#Contents">To ToC</a></span></h2>

<h4>THE BLAISOIS AND THE SOLOGNE</h4>


<p>The Blésois or Blaisois was the ancient name
given to the <i>petit pays</i> which made a part of
the government of the Orléannais. It was, and
is, the borderland between the Orléannais and
Touraine, and, with its capital, Blois, the city
of counts, was a powerful territory in its own
right, in spite of the allegiance which it owed
to the Crown. Twenty leagues in length by
thirteen in width, it was bounded on the north
by the Dunois and the Orléannais, on the east
by Berry, on the south by Touraine, and on
the west by Touraine and the Vendomois.</p>

<p>Blois, its capital, was famed ever in the
annals of the middle ages, and to-day no city
in the Loire valley possesses more sentimental
interest for the traveller than does Blois.</p>

<p>To the eastward lay the sands of the Sologne,
and southward the ample and fruitful Touraine,
hence Blois's position was one of su<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">57</a></span>preme
importance, and there is no wonder that
it proved to be the scene of so many momentous
events of history.</p>

<p>The present day Department of the Loir
et Cher was carved out from the Blaisois, the
Vendomois, and the Orléannais. The Baisois
was, in olden time, one of the most important
of the <i>petits gouvernements</i> of all the kingdom,
and gave to Blois a line of counts who rivalled
in power and wealth the churchmen of Tours
and the dukes of Brittany. Gregory of Tours
is the first historian who makes mention of
the ancient <i>Pagus Blensensis</i>.</p>

<p>One must not tell the citizen of Blois that it
is at Tours that one hears the best French
spoken. Everybody knows this, but the inhabitant
of the Blaisois will not admit it, and, in
truth, to the stranger there is not much apparent
difference. Throughout this whole region
he understands and makes himself understood
with much more facility than in any other part
of France.</p>

<p>For one thing, not usually recalled, Blois
should be revered and glorified. It was the
native place of Lenoir, who invented the instrument
which made possible the definite determination
of the metric system of measurement.</p>

<p>One reads in Bernier's "Histoire de Blois"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span>
that the inhabitants are "honest, gallant, and
polite in conversation, and of a delicate and
diffident temperament." This was written
nearly a century ago, but there is no excuse
for one's changing the opinion to-day unless,
as was the misfortune of the writer, he runs
up against an unusually
importunate vender
of post-cards or an
aggressive <i>garçon de
café</i>.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/illus079_small.jpg" alt="Arms of the City of Blois" title="Arms of the City of Blois" />
</div>


<p>Blois, among all the
cities of the Loire, is
the favourite with the
tourist. Why this
should be is an enigma.
It is overburdened,
at times, with droves of tourists, and
this in itself is a detraction in the eyes of
many.</p>

<p>Perhaps it is because here one first meets
a great château of state; and certainly the
Château de Blois lives in one's memory more
than any other château in France.</p>



<p>Much has been written of Blois, its counts,
its château, and its many and famous <i>hôtels</i>
of the nobility, by writers of all opinions and
abilities, from those old chroniclers who wrote<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">59</a></span>
of the plots and intrigues of other days to those
critics of art and architecture who have discovered&mdash;or
think they have discovered&mdash;that
Da Vinci designed the famous spiral staircase.</p>

<p>From this one may well gather that Blois is
the foremost château of all the Loire in popularity
and theatrical effect. Truly this is so,
but it is by no manner of means the most lovable;
indeed, it is the least lovable of all that
great galaxy which begins at Blois and ends
at Nantes. It is a show-place and not much
more, and partakes in every form and feature&mdash;as
one sees it to-day&mdash;of the attributes of
a museum, and such it really is. All of its
former gorgeousness is still there, and all the
banalities of the later period when Gaston of
Orleans built his ugly wing, for the "personally
conducted" to marvel at, and honeymoon
couples to envy. The French are quite fond
of visiting this shrine themselves, but usually
it is the young people and their mammas, and
detached couples of American and English
birth that one most sees strolling about the
courts and apartments were formerly lords
and ladies and cavaliers moved and plotted.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<div class="caption"><a href="images/illus091.jpg"><i>The Riverside at Blois</i></a></div>
</div>

<p>The great château of the Counts of Blois is
built upon an inclined rock which rises above<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">60</a></span>
the roof-tops of the lower town quite in fairy-book
fashion,&mdash;</p>


<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0_5">"... Bâtie en pierre et d'ardoise converte,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Blanche et carrée au bas de la colline verte."<br /></span>
</div></div>


<p>Commonly referred to as the Château de
Blois, it is really composed of four separate
and distinct foundations; the original château
of the counts; the later addition of Louis XII.;
the palace of François I., and the most unsympathetically
and dismally disposed <i>pavillon</i> of
Gaston of Orleans.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/illus094_small.jpg" alt="Signature of François Premier" title="Signature of François Premier" />
<div class="caption"><i>Signature of François Premier</i></div>
</div>

<p>The artistic qualities of the greater part of
the distinct edifices which go to make up the
château as it stands to-day are superb, with
the exception of that great wing of Gaston's,
before mentioned, which is as cold and unfeeling
as the overrated palace at Versailles.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">61</a></span></p>

<p>The Comtes de Chatillon built that portion
just to the right of the present entrance;
Louis XII., the edifice through which one enters
the inner court and which extends far to the
left, including also the chapel immediately to
the rear; while François Premier, who here as
elsewhere let his unbounded Italian proclivities
have full sway, built the extended wing to
the left of the inner court and fronting on the
present Place du Château, formerly the Place
Royale.</p>

<p>Immediately to the left, in the Basse Cour
de Château, are the Hôtel d'Amboise, the Hôtel
d'Épernon, and farther away, in the Rue St.
Honore, the Hôtel Sardini, the Hôtel d'Alluye,
and a score of others belonging to the nobility
of other days; all of them the scenes of many
stirring and gallant events in Renaissance
times.</p>

<p>This is hardly the place for a discussion of
the merits or demerits of any particular artistic
style, but the frequently repeated expression
of Buffon's "<i>Le style, c'est l'homme</i>"
may well be paraphrased into "<i>L'art, c'est
l'époque.</i>" In fact one finds at all times imprinted
upon the architectural style of any
period the current mood bred of some historical
event or a passing fancy.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">62</a></span></p>

<p>At Blois this is particularly noticeable. As
an architectural monument the château is a
picturesque assemblage of edifices belonging
to many different epochs, and, as such, shows,
as well as any other document of contemporary
times, the varying ambitions and emotions of
its builders, from the rude and rough manners
of the earliest of feudal times through the
highly refined Renaissance details of the imaginative
brain of François, down to the base concoction
of the elder Mansart, produced at the
commands of Gaston of Orleans.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<a href="images/illus096.jpg">
<img src="images/illus096_small.jpg" alt="Cypher of Anne de Bretagne, at Blois" title="Cypher of Anne de Bretagne, at Blois" />
</a>
</div>

<p>The whole gamut, from the gay and winsome
to the sad and dismal, is found here.</p>

<p>The escutcheons of the various occupants
are plainly in evidence,&mdash;the swan pierced by
an arrow of the first Counts of Blois; the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span>
ermine of Anne de Bretagne; the porcupine
of the Ducs d'Orleans, and the salamander of
François Premier.</p>

<p>In the earliest structure were to be seen all
the attributes of a feudal fortress, towers and
walls pierced with narrow loopholes, and damp,
dark dungeons hidden away in the thick walls.
Then came a structure which was less of a
fortress and more habitable, but still a stronghold,
though having ample and decorative doorways
and windows, with curious sculptures and
rich framings. Then the pompous Renaissance
with <i>escaliers</i> and <i>balcons à jour</i>, balustrades
crowning the walls, arabesques enriching the
pilasters and walls, and elaborate cornices here,
there, and everywhere,&mdash;all bespeaking the
gallantry and taste of the <i>roi-chevalier</i>. Finally
came the cold, classic features of the
period of the brother of Louis XIII., decidedly
the worst and most unlivable and unlovely
architecture which France has ever produced.
All these features are plain in the general
scheme of the Château de Blois to-day, and
doubtless it is this that makes the appeal; too
much loveliness, as at Chenonceaux or Azay-le-Rideau,
staggers the modern mortal by the
sheer impossibility of its modern attainment.</p>

<p>In plan the Château de Blois forms an irreg<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">64</a></span>ular
square situated at the apex of a promontory
high above the surface of the Loire, and
practically behind the town itself. The building
has a most picturesque aspect, and, to those
who know, gives practically a history of the
château architecture of the time. Abandoned,
mutilated, and dishonoured from time to time,
the structure gradually took on new forms until
the thick walls underlying the apartment
known to-day as the Salle des États&mdash;probably
the most ancient portion of all&mdash;were
overshadowed by the great richness of the fifteenth
and sixteenth centuries. One early fragment
was entirely enveloped in the structure
which was built by François Premier, the ancient
Tour de Château Regnault, or De Moulins,
or Des Oubliettes, as it was variously
known, and from the outside this is no longer
visible.</p>

<p>From the platform one sees a magnificent
panorama of the city and the far-reaching
Loire, which unrolls itself southward and
northward for many leagues, its banks covered
by rich vineyards and crowned by thick forests.</p>

<p>The building of Louis XII. presents its brick-faced
exterior in black and red lozenge shapes,
with sculptured window-frames, squarely upon
the little tree-bordered <i>place</i> of to-day, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">65</a></span>
in other times formed a part of that magnificent
terrace which looked down upon the roof
of the Église St. Nicolas, and the Jesuit Church
of the Immaculate Conception, and the silvery
belt of the Loire itself.</p>

<div class="figright">
<a href="images/illus099.jpg">
<img src="images/illus099_small.jpg" alt="Arms of Louis XII" title="Arms of Louis XII" />
</a></div>


<p>On the west façade of this vast conglomerate
structure one sees the effigy of the porcupine,
that weird symbol adopted by the family of
Orleans.</p>

<p>The choice of this ungainly animal&mdash;in spite
of which it is most decorative in outline&mdash;was
due to the first Louis, who was Duc d'Orleans.
In the year 1393 Louis founded the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span>
order of the porcupine, in honour of the birth
of Charles, his eldest son, who was born to him
by Valentine de Milan. The legend which accompanied
the adoption of the symbol&mdash;though
often enough it was missing in the
sculptured representations&mdash;was <i>Cominus et
eminus</i>, which had its origin in the belief
that the porcupine could defend himself
in a near attack, but that when he himself
attacked, he fought from afar by launching
forth his spines.</p>

<p>Naturalists will tell you that the porcupine
does no such thing; but in those days it was
evidently believed that he did, and in many, if
not all, of the sculptured effigies that one sees
of the beast there is a halo of detached spines
forming a background as if they were really
launching themselves forth in mid-air.</p>

<p>Above this central doorway, or entrance to
the courtyard, is a niche in which is a modern
equestrian statue of Louis XII., replacing a
more ancient one destroyed at the Revolution.
This old statue, it is claimed, was an admirable
work of art in its day, and the present
statue is thought to be a replica of it.</p>

<p>It originally bore the following inscription&mdash;a
verse written by Fausto Andrelini, the
king's favourite poet.

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">67</a></span></p>

<div class="caption"><a href="images/illus101.png"><i>Central Doorway,<br/>Château de Blois</i></a></div>
</div>

<p>According to an old French description this
old statue was: "<i>très beau et très agréable
ainsy que tous ses portraits l'ont représenté,
comme celui qui est au grand portail de
Bloys</i>."</p>

<p>Above rises a balustrade with fantastic gargoyles
with the pinnacles and fleurons of the
window gables all very ornate, the whole
topped off with a roofing of slate.</p>

<p>Blois, in its general aspect, is fascinating;
but it is not sympathetic, and this is not surprising
when one remembers men and women
who worked their deeds of bloody daring
within its walls.</p>

<p>The murders and other acts of violence and
treason which took place here are interesting
enough, but one cannot but feel, when he views
the chimneypiece before which the Duc de
Guise was standing when called to his death
in the royal closet, that the men of whom the
bloody tales of Blois are told quite deserved
their fates.</p>

<p>One comes away with the impression of it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">68</a></span>
all stamped only upon the mind, not graven
upon the heart. Political intrigue to-day, if
quite as vulgar, is less sordid. Bigotry and
ambition in those days allowed few of the finer
feelings to come to the surface, except with
regard to the luxuriance of surroundings. Of
this last there can be no question, and Blois
is as characteristically luxurious as any of the
magnificent edifices which lodged the royalty
and nobility of other days, throughout the
valley of the Loire.</p>

<p>A numismatic curiosity, connected with the
history of the Château de Blois, is an ancient
piece of money which one may see in the local
museum. It is the oldest document in existence
in which, or on which, the name of Blois is
mentioned. On one side is a symbolical figure
and the legend <i>Bleso Castro</i>, and on the other
a <i>croix haussée</i> and the name of the officer of
the mint at Blois, <i>Pre Cistato, monetario</i>.</p>

<p>The plan of the Château de Blois here given
shows it not as it is to-day, but as it was at
the death of Gaston d'Orleans in 1660. The
constructions of the different epochs are noted
on the plan as follows:</p>

<p>The interior court is partly surrounded by
a colonnade, quite cloister-like in effect. At
the right centre of the François I. wing is that
wonderful spiral staircase, concerning the in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a></span>vention
of which so much speculation has been
launched. Leonardo da Vinci, the protégé of
François, has been given the honour, and a
very considerable volume has been written to
prove the claim.</p>

<div class="figleft">

</div>


<p>Within this "<i>tour octagone"&mdash;"qui fait
à ses huit pans hurler un gorgone</i>"&mdash;is built
this marvellous openwork stairway,&mdash;an <i>escalier
à jour</i>, as the French call it,&mdash;without
an equal in all France, and for daring and
decorative effect unexcelled by any of those
Renaissance motives of Italy itself. Its ascent
turns not, as do most <i>escaliers</i>, from left to
right, but from right to left. It is the prototype
of those supposedly unique outside staircases<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">73</a></span>
pointed out to country cousins in the
abodes of Fifth Avenue millionaires.</p>

<p>It is as impossible to catalogue the various
apartments and their accessories here, as it is
to include a chronology of the great events
which have passed within their walls. One
thing should be remembered, and that is, that
the architect Duban restored the château
throughout in recent years. In spite of this
restoration one may readily enough reconstruct
the scene of the murder of the Duc de
Guise from the great fireplace on the second
floor before which De Guise was standing when
summoned by a page to the kingly presence,
from the door through which he entered to his
death, and from the wall where hung the
tapestry behind which he was to pass. All this
is real enough, and also the "Tour des Oubliettes,"
in which the duke's brother, the cardinal,
suffered, and of which many horrible
tales are still told by the attendants.</p>

<p>Duban, the architect, came with his careful
restorations and pictured with a most exact
fidelity the decorations and the furnishings of
the times of François, of Catherine, and of
Henri III. The ornate chimneypieces have
been furbished up anew, the walls and ceilings
covered with new paint and gold; nothing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">74</a></span>
could be more opulent or glorious, but it gives
the impression of a city dwelling or a great
hotel, "newly done up," as the house renovators
express it.</p>

<p>One contrasting emotion will be awakened
by a contemplation of the two great Salles des
Gardes and the apartments of Catherine de
Medici; here, at least for the moment, is a
relief from the intrigues, massacres, and assassinations
which otherwise went on, for one recalls
that, at one period, "<i>danses, ballets et
jeux</i>" took place here continuously.</p>

<p>In the apartments of Catherine there is much
to remind one of "the base Florentine," as it
has been the fashion of latter-day historians
to describe the first of the Medici queens.
Nothing could be more sumptuous than the
Galerie de la Reine, her <i>Cabinet de Toilette</i>,
or her <i>Chambre à Coucher</i>, with its secret
panels, where she died on the 5th of January,
1589, "adored and revered," but soon forgotten,
and of no more account than "<i>une
chèvre mort</i>," says one old chronicler.</p>

<p>The apartments of Catherine de Medici
were directly beneath the guard-room where
the Balafré was murdered, and that event,
taking place at the very moment when the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">75</a></span>
"queen-mother" was dying, cannot be said
to have been conducive to a peaceful demise.</p>

<p>Here, on the first floor of the François
Premier wing, the <i>reine-mère</i> held her court,
as did the king his. The great gallery overlooked
the town on the side of the present
Place du Château. It was, and is, a truly
grand apartment, with diamond-paned windows,
and rich, dark, wall decorations on which
Catherine's device, a crowned C and her monogram
in gold, frequently appears. There was,
moreover, a great oval window, opposite which
stood her altar, and a doorway, half concealed,
led to her writing-closet, with its secret drawers
and wall-panels which well served her purposes
of intrigue and deceit. A hidden stairway
led to the floor above, and there was a
<i>chambre à coucher</i>, with a deep recess for the
bed, the same to which she called her son Henri
as she lay dying, admonishing him to give up
the thought of murdering Guise. "What,"
said Henri, on this embarrassing occasion,
"spare Guise, when he, triumphant in Paris,
dared lay his hand on the hilt of his sword!
Spare him who drove me a fugitive from the
capital! Spare them who never spared me!
No, mother, I will <i>not</i>."</p>

<p>As the queen-mother drew near her end,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">76</a></span>
and was lying ill at Blois, great events for
France were culminating at the château.
Henri III. had become King of France, and
the Balafré, supported by Rome and Spain,
was in open rebellion against the reigning
house, and the word had gone forth that the
Duc de Guise must die. The States General
were to be immediately assembled, and De
Guise, once the poetic lover of Marguerite,
through his emissaries canvassed all France
to ensure the triumph of the party of the
Church against Henri de Navarre and his
queen,&mdash;the Marguerite whom De Guise once
professed to love,&mdash;who soon were to come to
the throne of France.</p>

<p>The uncomfortable Henri III. had been told
that he would never be king in reality until
De Guise had been made away with.</p>

<p>The final act of the drama between the rival
houses of Guise and Valois came when the
king and his council came to Blois for the
Assembly. The sunny city of Blois was indeed
to be the scene of a momentous affair, and a
truly sumptuous setting it was, the roof-tops
of its houses sloping downward gently to the
Loire, with the chief accessory, the coiffed and
turreted château itself, high above all else.</p>

<p>Details had been arranged with infinite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">77</a></span>
pains, the guard doubled, and a company of
Swiss posted around the courtyard and up and
down the gorgeous staircase. Every nook and
corner has its history in connection with this
greatest event in the history of the Château of
Blois.</p>

<p>As Guise entered the council-chamber he was
told that the king would see him in his closet,
to reach which one had to pass through the
guard-room below. The door was barred behind
him that he might not return, when the
trusty guards of the "Forty-fifth," under
Dalahaide, already hidden behind the wall-tapestry,
sprang upon the Balafré and forced
him back upon the closed door through which
he had just passed. Guise fell stabbed in the
breast by Malines, and "lay long uncovered
until an old carpet was found in which to wrap
his corpse."</p>

<p>Below, in her own apartments, lay the queen-mother,
dying, but listening eagerly for the
rush of footsteps overhead, hoping and praying
that Henri&mdash;the hitherto effeminate Henri
who played with his sword as he would with a
battledore, and who painted himself like a
woman, and put rings in his ears&mdash;would not
prejudice himself at this time in the eyes of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">78</a></span>
Rome by slaying the leader of the Church
party.</p>

<p>Guise died as Henri said he would die, with
the words on his lips: "<i>A moi, mes amis!&mdash;trahison!&mdash;à
moi, Guise,&mdash;je me meurs</i>," but
the revenge of the Church party came when, at
St. Cloud, the monk, Jacques Clément, poignarded
the last of the Valois, and put the then
heretical Henri de Navarre on the throne of
France.</p>

<p>Within the southernmost confines of the
château is the Tour de Foix, so called for the
old faubourg near by. The upper story and
roof of this curious round tower was the work
of Catherine de Medici, who installed there her
astrologer and maker of philtres, Cosmo Ruggieri.</p>

<p>Ruggieri was a most versatile person; he
was astrologer, alchemist, and philosopher
alike, besides being many other kinds of a
rogue, all of which was very useful to the
Medici now that she had come to power.</p>

<p>Catherine built an outside stairway up to the
platform of this tower, and a great, flat, stone
table was placed there to form a foundation
for Ruggieri's cabalistic instruments. Even
this stone table itself was an uncanny affair,
if we are to believe the old chronicles. It rang<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">79</a></span>
out in a clear sharp note whenever struck with
some hard body, and on its surface was graven
a line which led the eye directly toward the
golden <i>fleur-de-lys</i> on the cupola of Chambord's
château, some three leagues distant on
the other side of the Loire. What all this symbolism
actually meant nobody except Catherine
and her astrologer knew; at least, the details
do not appear to have come down to enlighten
posterity. Over the doorway of the observatory
were graven the words, "<i>Vraniæ Sacrum</i>,"
<i>i. e.</i>, consecrated to Uranius.</p>

<p>Wherever Catherine chose to reside, whether
in Touraine or at Paris, her astrologer and his
"<i>observatoire</i>" formed a part of her train.
She had brought Cosmo from Italy, and never
for a moment did he leave her. He was a sort
of a private demon on whom Catherine could
shoulder her poisonings and her stabs, and,
as before said, he was an exceedingly busy
functionary of the court.</p>

<p>That part of the structure built by Mansart
for Gaston d'Orleans appears strange,
solemn, and superfluous in connection with the
sumptuousness of the earlier portions. With
what poverty the architectural art of the
seventeenth century expressed itself! What an
inferiority came with the passing of the six<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">80</a></span>teenth
century and the advent of the following!
One finds a certain grandeur in the outlines of
this last wing, with its majestic cupola over
the entrance pavilion, but the general effect
of the decorations is one of a great paucity of
invention when compared to the more brilliant
Renaissance forerunners on the opposite side
of the courtyard.</p>

<p>It was under the régime of Gaston d'Orleans
that the gardens of the Château de Blois came
to their greatest excellence and beauty. In
1653 Abel Brunyer, the first physician of Gaston's
suite, published a catalogue of the fruits
and flowers to be found here in these gardens,
of which he was also director. More than five
hundred varieties were included, three-quarters
of which belonged to the flora of France.</p>

<p>Among the delicacies and novelties of the
time to be found here was the Prunier de Reine
Claude, from which those delicious green plums
known to all the world to-day as "Reine
Claudes" were propagated, also another variety
which came from the Prunier de Monsieur,
somewhat similar in taste but of a deep purple
colour. The <i>pomme de terre</i> was tenderly
cared for and grown as a great novelty and
delicacy long before its introduction to general
cultivation by Parmentier. The tomato was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">81</a></span>
imported from Mexico, and even tobacco was
grown; from which it may be judged that Gaston
did not intend to lack the good things of life.</p>

<p>All these facts are recounted in Brunyer's
"Hortus Regius Blesensis," and, in addition,
one Morrison, an expatriate Scotch doctor, who
had attached himself to Gaston, also wrote a
competing work which was published in London
in 1669 under the title of "Preludia Botanica,"
and which dealt at great length with the
already celebrated gardens of the Château de
Blois.</p>

<p>Morrison placed at the head of his work a
Latin verse which came in time to be graven
over the gateway of the gardens. This&mdash;as
well as pretty much all record of it&mdash;has disappeared,
but a repetition of the lines will
serve to show with what admiration this paradise
was held:</p>

<p>Not merely in history has the famous château
at Blois played its part. Writers of fic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">82</a></span>tion
have more than once used it as an accessory
or the principal scenic background of their
sword and cloak novels; none more effectively
than Dumas in the D'Artagnan series.</p>

<p>The opening lines of "Le Vicomte de Bragelonne"
are laid here. "It should have been
a source of pride to the city of Blois," says
Dumas, "that Gaston of Orleans had chosen
it as his residence, and held his court in the
ancient château of the States."</p>

<p>Here, too, in the second volume of the D'Artagnan
romances, is the scene of that most
affecting meeting between his Majesty Charles
II., King of England, and Louis XIV.</p>

<p>Altogether one lives here in the very spirit
of the pages of Dumas. Not only Blois, but
Langeais, Chambord, Cheverny, Amboise, and
many other châteaux figure in the novels with
an astonishing frequency, and, whatever the
critics may say of the author's slips of pen
and memory, Dumas has given us a wonderfully
faithful picture of the life of the times.</p>

<p>In 1793 all the symbols and emblems of royalty
were removed from the château and destroyed.
The celebrated bust of Gaston, the
chief artistic attribute of that part of the edifice
built by him, was decapitated, and the
statue of Louis XII. over the entrance gateway<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">83</a></span>
was overturned and broken up. Afterward the
château became the property of the "domaine"
and was turned into a mere barracks.
The Pavilion of Queen Anne became a "<i>magasin
des subsistances militaires</i>," the Tour de
l'Observatoire, a powder-magazine, and all the
indignities imaginable were heaped upon the
château.</p>

<p>In 1814 Blois became the last capital of
Napoleon's empire, and the château walls sheltered
the prisoners captured by the imperial
army.</p>

<p>Blois's most luxurious church edifice was the
old abbey church of St. Sauveur, which was
built from 1138 to 1210. It lost the royal favour
in 1697, when Louis XIV. made Blois a
city of bishops as well as of counts, and transferred
the chapter of St. Sauveur's to the bastard
Gothic edifice first known as St. Solenne,
but which soon took on the name of St. Louis.
In spite of the claims of the old church, this
cold, unfeeling, and ugly mixture of tomblike
Renaissance became, and still remains, the
bishop's church of Blois.</p>

<p>One must not neglect or forget the magnificent
bridge which crosses the Loire at Blois.
A work of 1717-24, it bears the Rue Denis
Papin across its eleven solidly built masonry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">84</a></span>
piers. Above the central arch is erected a
memorial pyramid and tablet which states the
fact that it was one of the first works of the
reign of Louis XV.</p>

<p>Blois altogether, then, offers a multitudinous
array of attractions for the tourist who makes
his first entrance to the châteaux country
through its doors. The town itself has not the
appeal of Tours, of Angers, or of Nantes; but,
for all that, its abundance of historic lore, the
admirable preservation of its chief monument,
and the general picturesqueness of its site and
the country round about make up for many
other qualities that may be lacking.</p>

<p>The Sologne, lying between Blois, Vierzon,
and Châteauneuf-sur-Loire, is a great region
of lakelets, sandy soil, and replanted Corsican
pines, which to-day has taken on a new lease
of life and a prosperity which was unknown
in the days when the Comtes de Blois first
erected that <i>maison de plaisance</i>, on its western
border which was afterward to aggrandize itself
into the later Château de Chambord. The
soil has been drained and the vine planted to
a hitherto undreamed of extent, until to-day,
if the land does not exactly blossom like the
rose, it at least somewhat approaches it.</p>

<p>The <i>chaumières</i> of the Sologne have disap<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">85</a></span>peared
to a large extent, and their mud walls
and thatched roofs are not as frequent a detail
of the landscape as formerly, but even now there
is a distinct individuality awaiting the artist
who will go down among these vineyard workers
of the Sologne and paint them and their
surroundings as other parts have been painted
and popularized. It will be hot work in the
summer months, and lonesome work at all times,
but there is a new note to be sounded if one
but has the ear for it, and it is to be heard right
here in this tract directly on the beaten track
from north to south, and yet so little known.</p>

<p>The peasant of the Sologne formerly ate his
<i>soupe au poireau</i> and a morsel of <i>fromage
maigre</i> and was as content and happy as if his
were a more luxurious board, as it in reality
became when a stranger demanded hospitality.
Then out from the <i>armoire</i>&mdash;that ever present
adjunct of a French peasant's home, whether
it be in Normandy, Touraine, or the Midi&mdash;came
a bottle of <i>vin blanc</i>, bought in the wine-shops
of Romorantin or Vierzon on some of
his periodical trips to town.</p>

<p>To-day all is changing, and the peasant of
the Sologne nourishes himself better and trims
his beard and wears a round white collar on
fête-days. He is proud of his well-kept appear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">86</a></span>ance,
but his neighbours to the north and the
south will tell you that all this hides a deep
malice, which is hard to believe, in spite of
the well recognized saying, "<i>Sot comme un
Solognat</i>." The women have a physiognomy
more passive; when young they are fresh and
lip-lively, but as they grow older their charms
pass quickly.</p>

<p>The Sologne in most respects has changed
greatly since the days of Arthur Young. Then
this classic land was reviled and vehement imprecations
were launched upon the proprietors
of its soil,&mdash;"those brilliant and ambitious
gentlemen" who figure so largely in the ceremonies
of Versailles. To-day all is changed,
and the gentleman farmer is something more
than a <i>bourgeois parisien</i> who hunts and rides
and apes "<i>le sport</i>" of the English country
squire.</p>

<p>The jack-rabbit and the hare are the pests
of the Sologne now that its sandy soil has been
conquered, but they are quite successfully kept
down in numbers, and the insects which formerly
ravaged the vines are likewise less
offensive than they used to be, so the Sologne
may truly be said to have been transformed.</p>

<p>To-day, as in the days of the royal hunt,
when Chambord was but a shooting-box of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">87</a></span>
Counts of Blois, the Sologne is rife with small
game, and even deer and an occasional <i>sanglier</i>.</p>

<p>"<i>La chasse</i>" in France is no mean thing
to-day, and the Sologne, La Beauce, and the
great national forests of Lyons and Rambouillet
draw&mdash;on the opening of the season,
somewhere between the 28th of August and
the 2d of September of each year&mdash;their
hundreds of thousands of Nimrods and disciples
of St. Hubert. The bearer of the gun
in France is indeed a most ardent sportsman,
and in no European country can one buy in
the open market a greater variety of small
game,&mdash;all the product of those who pay their
twenty francs for the privilege of bagging rabbits,
hares, partridges, and the like. The hunters
of France enjoy one superstition, however,
and that is that to accidentally bag a crow on
the first shot means a certain and sudden death
before the day is over.</p>

<p>La Motte-Beuvron is celebrated in the annals
of the Sologne; it is, in fact, the metropolis
of the region, and the centre from which radiated
the influences which conquered the soil
and made of it a prosperous land, where formerly
it was but a sandy, arid desert. La
Motte-Beuvron is a long-drawn-out <i>bourgade</i>,
like some of the populous centres of the great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">88</a></span>
plain of Hungary, and there is no great prosperity
or "up-to-dateness" to be observed, in
spite of its constantly increasing importance,
for La Motte-Beuvron and the country round
about is one of the localities of France which
is apparently not falling off in its population.</p>

<p>La Motte has a most imposing Hôtel de Ville,
a heavy edifice of brick built by Napoleon III.&mdash;who
has never been accused of having had
the artistic appreciation of his greater ancestor&mdash;after
the model of the Arsenal at Venice.</p>

<p>This is all La Motte has to warrant remark
unless one is led to investigate the successful
agricultural experiment which is still being
carried out hereabouts. La Motte's hôtels and
cafés are but ordinary, and there is no counter
attraction of boulevard or park to place the
town among those lovable places which travellers
occasionally come upon unawares.</p>

<p>To realize the Sologne at its best and in its
most changed aspect, one should follow the
roadway from La Motte to Blois. He may
either go by tramway <i>à vapeur</i>, or by his own
means of communication. In either case he will
then know why the prosperity of the Sologne
and the contentment of the Solognat is assured.</p>

<p>Romorantin, still characteristic of the Sologne
and its historic capital, is famous for its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">89</a></span>
asparagus and its paternal château of François
Premier, where that prince received the
scar upon his face, at a tourney, which compelled
him ever after to wear a beard.</p>

<p>To-day the Sous-Préfecture, the Courts and
their prisoners, the Gendarmerie, and the Theatre
are housed under the walls that once
formed the château royal of Jean d'Angoulême;
within whose apartments the gallant
François was brought up.</p>

<div class="figleft">

<div class="caption"><a href="images/illus125.jpg"><i>Native Types in the Sologne</i></a></div>
</div>

<p>The Sologne, like most of the other of the
<i>petits pays</i> of France, is prolific in superstitions
and traditionary customs, and here for
some reason they deal largely of the marriage
state. When the <i>paysan solognais</i> marries, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">90</a></span>
takes good care to press the marriage-ring well
up to the third joint of his spouse's finger,
"else she will be the master of the house,"
which is about as well as the thing can be expressed
in English. It seems a simple precaution,
and any one so minded might well do the
same under similar circumstances, provided he
thinks the proceeding efficacious.</p>

<p>Again, during the marriage ceremony itself,
each of the parties most interested bears a
lighted wax taper, with the belief that whichever
first burns out, so will its bearer die first.
It's a gruesome thought, perhaps, but it gives
one an inkling of who stands the best chance
of inheriting the other's goods, which is what
matches are sometimes made for.</p>

<p>The marriage ceremony in the Sologne is a
great and very public function. Intimates,
friends, acquaintances, and any of the neighbouring
populace who may not otherwise be
occupied, attend, and eat, drink, and ultimately
get merry. But they have a sort of process of
each paying his or her own way; at least a collection
is taken up to pay for the entertainment,
for the Sologne peasant would otherwise start
his married life in a state of bankruptcy from
which it would take him a long time to recover.</p>

<p>The collection is made with considerable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">91</a></span>
<i>éclat</i> and has all the elements of picturesqueness
that one usually associates with the wedding
processions that one sees on the comic-opera
stage. A sort of nuptial bouquet&mdash;a
great bunch of field flowers&mdash;is handed round
from one guest to another, and for a sniff of
their fragrance and a participation in the collation
which is to come, they make an offering,
dropping much or little into a golden (not gold)
goblet which is passed around by the bride herself.</p>

<p>In the Sologne there is (or was, for the
writer has never seen it) another singular custom
of the marriage service&mdash;not really a part
of the churchly office, but a sort of practical
indorsement of the actuality of it all.</p>

<p>The bride and groom are both pricked with
a needle until the blood runs, to demonstrate
that neither the man nor the woman is insensible
or dreaming as to the purport of the ceremony
about to take place.</p>

<p>As every French marriage is at the Mairie,
as well as being held in church, this double
ceremony (and the blood-letting as well) must
make a very hard and fast agreement. Perhaps
it might be tried elsewhere with advantage.</p>

<p>Montrichard, on the Cher, is on the border<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">92</a></span>land
between the Blaisois and Touraine. Its
donjon announces itself from afar as a magnificent
feudal ruin. The town is moreover
most curious and original, the great rectangular
donjon rising high into the sky above a
series of cliff-dwellers' chalk-cut homes, in
truly weird fashion.</p>

<p>There is nothing so very remarkable about
cliff-dwellers in the Loire country, and their
aspect, manners, and customs do not differ
greatly from those of their neighbours, who
live below them.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/illus129_small.jpg" alt="Donjon of Montrichard" title="Donjon of Montrichard" />
<div class="caption"><a href="images/illus129.jpg"><i>Donjon of Montrichard</i></a></div>
</div>

<p>Curiously enough these rock-cut dwellings
appear dry and healthful, and are not in the
least insalubrious, though where a <i>cave</i> has
been devoted only to the storage of wine in
vats, barrels, and bottles the case is somewhat
different.</p>

<p>Montrichard itself, outside of these scores
of homes burrowed out of the cliff, is most
picturesque, with stone-pignoned gables and
dormer-windows and window-frames cut or
worked in wood or stone into a thousand
amusing shapes.</p>

<p>Montrichard, with Chinon, takes the lead in
interesting old houses in these parts; in fact,
they quite rival the ruinous lean-to houses of
Rouen and Lisieux in Normandy, which is say<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">93</a></span>ing
a good deal for their picturesque qualities.</p>

<p>One-third of Montrichard's population live
underground or in houses built up against the
hillsides. Even the lovely old parish church
backs against the rock.</p>

<p>Everywhere are stairways and <i>petits chemins</i>
leading upward or downward, with little
façades, windows, or doorways coming upon
one in most unexpected and mysterious fashion
at every turn.</p>

<p>The magnificent donjon is a relic of the work
of that great fortress-builder, Foulques Nerra,
Comte d'Anjou, who dotted the land wherever
he trod with these masterpieces of their kind,
most of them great rectangular structures like
the donjons of Britain, but quite unlike the
structures of their class mostly seen in France.</p>

<p>Richard C&#339;ur de Lion occupied the fortress
in 1108, but was obliged to succumb to his rival
in power, Philippe-Auguste, who in time made
a breach in its walls and captured it. Thereafter
it became an outpost of his own, from
whence he could menace the Comte d'Anjou.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">94</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER IV.<span class="pagenum"><a href="#Contents">To ToC</a></span></h2>

<h4>CHAMBORD</h4>


<p>Chambord is four leagues from Blois, from
which point it is usually approached. To reach
it one crosses the Sologne, not the arid waste
it has been pictured, but a desert which has
been made to blossom as the rose.</p>

<p>A glance of the eye, given anywhere along
the road from Blois to Chambord, will show
a vineyard of a thousand, two thousand, or
even more acres, where, from out of a soil that
was once supposed to be the poorest in all wine-growing
France, may be garnered a crop equalling
a hundred dozen of bottles of good rich
wine to the acre.</p>

<p>This wine of the Sologne is not one of the
famous wines of France, to be sure, but what
one gets in these parts is pure and astonishingly
palatable; moreover, one can drink large
portions of it&mdash;as do the natives&mdash;without
being affected in either his head or his pocket-book.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">95</a></span></p>

<p>From late September to early December
there is a constant harvest going on in the
vineyards, whose labourers, if not as picturesque
and joyous as we are wont to see them
on the comic-opera stage, are at least wonderfully
clever and industrious, for they make a
good wine crop out of a soil which previously
gave a living only to charcoal-burners and goat-keepers.</p>

<p>François was indeed a rare devotee of the
building mania when he laid out the wood
which surrounds Chambord and which ultimately
grew to some splendour. The nineteenth
century saw this great wood cut and
sold in huge quantities, so that to-day it is
rather a scanty copse through which one drives
on the way from Blois.</p>

<p>The country round about is by no means
impoverished,&mdash;far from it. It is simply unworked
to its fullest extent as yet. As it is
plentifully surrounded by water it makes an
ideal land for the growing of asparagus, strawberries,
and grapes, and so it has come to be
one of the most prosperous and contented
regions in all the Loire valley.</p>

<p>The great white Château de Chambord, with
its turrets and its magnificent lantern, looms
large from whatever direction it is approached,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">96</a></span>
though mostly it is framed by the somewhat
stunted pines which make up the pleasant forest.
The vistas which one sees when coming
toward Chambord, through the drives and
alleys of its park, with the château itself brilliant
in the distance, are charming and fairy-like
indeed. Straight as an arrow these roadways
run, and he who traverses one of those
centring at the château will see a tiny white
fleck in the sunlight a half a dozen kilometres
away, which, when it finally is reached, will be
admitted to be the greatest triumph of the art-loving
monarch.</p>

<p>François Premier was foremost in every
artistic expression in France, and the court,
as may be expected, were only too eager to
follow the expensive tastes of their monarch,&mdash;when
they could get the means, and when they
could not, often enough François supplied the
wherewithal.</p>

<p>François himself dressed in the richest of
Italian velvets, the more brilliant the better,
with a preponderant tendency toward pink and
sky blue.</p>

<p>A dozen years after François came to the
throne, a dozen years after the pleasant life
of Amboise, when mother, daughter, and son
lived together on the banks of the Loire in that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">97</a></span>
"Trinity of love," the monarch and his wife,
Queen Claude of France, the daughter of
Louis XII. and Anne of Brittany, came to live
at Chambord on the edge of the sandy Sologne
waste.</p>

<p>Here, too, came Marguerite d'Alençon, the
ever faithful and devoted sister of François,
the duke, her husband, and all the gay members
of the court. The hunt was the order of the
day, for the forest tract of the Sologne, scanty
though it was in growth, abounded in small
game.</p>

<p>Chambord at this time had not risen to the
grand and ornate proportions which we see
to-day, but set snugly on the low, swampy banks
of the tiny river Cosson, a dull, gloomy mediæval
fortress, whose only aspect of gaiety was
that brought by the pleasure-loving court when
it assembled there. In size it was ample to
accommodate the court, but François's artistic
temperament already anticipated many and
great changes. The Loire was to be turned
from its course and the future pompous palace
was to have its feet bathed in the limpid Loire
water rather than in the stagnant pools of the
morass which then surrounded it.</p>

<p>As a triumph of the royal château-builder's
art, Chambord is far and away ahead of Fon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">98</a></span>tainebleau
or Versailles, both of which were
built in a reign which ended two hundred years
later than that which began with the erection
of Chambord. As an example of the arts of
François I. and his time compared with those
of Louis XIV. and his, Chambord stands forth
with glorious significance.</p>

<p>On the low banks of the Cosson, François
achieved perhaps the greatest triumph that
Renaissance architecture had yet known.</p>

<p>It was either Chambord, or the reconstruction
by François of the edifice belonging to the
Counts of Blois, which resulted in the refinement
of the Renaissance style less than a quarter
of a century after its introduction into
France by Charles VIII.,&mdash;if he really was
responsible for its importation from Italy.
François lacked nothing of daring, and built
and embellished a structure which to-day, in
spite of numerous shortcomings, stands as the
supreme type of a great Renaissance domestic
edifice of state. Every device of decoration
and erratic suggestion seems to have been carried
out, not only structurally, as in the great
double spiral of its central stairway, but in its
interpolated details and symbolism as well.</p>

<p>It was at this time, too, that François began
to introduce the famous salamander into his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">99</a></span>
devices and ciphers; that most significant emblem
which one may yet see on wall and ceiling
of Chambord surrounded by the motto:
"<i>Je me nourris et je meurs dans le feu.</i>"</p>

<div class="caption"><a href="images/illus137.jpg"><i>Arms of François Premier, at Chambord</i></a></div>
</div>




<p>Chambord, first of all, gives one a very high
opinion of François Premier, and of the splendours
with which he was wont to surround
himself. The apartments are large and numerous
and are admirably planned and decorated,
though, almost without exception, bare to-day
of furniture or furnishings.</p>

<p>To quote the opinion of Blondel, the celebrated
French architect: "The Château de
Chambord, built under François I. and
Henri II., from the designs of Primatice, was
never achieved according to the original plan.
Louis XIII. and Louis XIV. contributed a cer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">100</a></span>tain
completeness, but the work was really
pursued afterward according to the notions of
one Sertio."</p>

<p>The masterpiece of its constructive elements
is its wonderful doubly spiralled central staircase,
which permits one to ascend or descend
without passing another proceeding in the
opposite direction at the same time. Whatever
may have been the real significance of this
great double spiral, it has been said that it
played its not unimportant part in the intrigue
and scandal of the time. It certainly is a wonder
of its kind, more marvellous even than that
spiral at Blois, attributed, with some doubt
perhaps, to Leonardo da Vinci, and certainly
far more beautiful than the clumsy round
tower up which horses and carriages were once
driven at Amboise.</p>

<p>At all events, it probably meant something
more than mere constructive ability, and a
staircase which allows one individual to mount
and another to descend without knowing of
the presence of the other may assuredly be
classed with those other mediæval accessories,
sliding panels, hidden doorways, and secret
cabinets.</p>

<p>Beneath the dome which terminates the staircase
in the Orleans wing are three caryatides<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">101</a></span>
representing&mdash;it is doubtfully stated&mdash;François
Premier, La Duchesse d'Étampes, and
Madame la Comtesse de Châteaubriand,&mdash;a
trinity of boon companions in intrigue.</p>

<p>In reality Chambord presents the curiously
contrived arrangement of one edifice within another,
as a glance of the eye at the plan will
show.</p>

<p>The fosse, the usual attribute of a great
mediæval château&mdash;it may be a dry one or
a wet one, in this case it was a wet one&mdash;has
disappeared, though Brantôme writes that he
saw great iron rings let into the walls to which
were attached "<i>barques et grands bateaux</i>,"
which had made their way from the Loire via
the dribbling Cosson.</p>

<p>The Cosson still dribbles its life away to-day,
its moisture having, to a great part, gone to
irrigate the sandy Sologne, but formerly it was
doubtless a much more ample stream.</p>

<p>From the park the ornate gables and dormer-windows
loom high above the green-swarded
banks of the Cosson. It was so in François's
time, and it is so to-day; nothing has been
added to break the spread of lawn, except an
iron-framed wash-house with red tiles and a
sheet-iron chimney-pot beside the little river,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">102</a></span>
and a tin-roofed garage for automobiles connected
with the little inn outside the gates.</p>

<p>The rest is as it was of yore, at least, the
same as the old engravings of a couple of hundreds
of years ago picture it, hence it is a great
shame, since the needs of the tiny village could
not have demanded it, that the foreground
could not have been left as it originally was.</p>

<p>The town, or rather village, or even hamlet,
of Chambord is about the most abbreviated
thing of its kind existent. There is practically
no village; there are a score or two of houses,
an inn of the frankly tourist kind, which evidently
does not cater to the natives, the aforesaid
wash-house by the river bank, the dwellings
of the gamekeepers, gardeners, and workmen
on the estate, and a diminutive church rising
above the trees not far away. These accessories
practically complete the make-up of the
little settlement of Chambord, on the borders
of the Blaisois and Touraine.</p>

<p>Chambord has been called top-heavy, but it
is hardly that. Probably the effect is caused
by its low-lying situation, for, as has been intimated
before, this most imposing of all of
the Loire châteaux has the least desirable situation
of any. There is a certain vagueness and
foreignness about the sky-line that is almost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">103</a></span>
Eastern, though we recognize it as pure Renaissance.
Perhaps it is the magnitude and lonesomeness
of it all that makes it seem so
strange, an effect that is heightened when one
steps out upon its roof, with the turrets, towers,
and cupolas still rising high above.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/illus141_small.jpg" alt="Plan of Chambord" title="Plan of Chambord" />
</div>

<p>The ground-plan is equally magnificent,
flanked at every corner by a great round tower,
with another quartette of them at the angles
of the interior court.</p>

<p>Most of the stonework of the fabric is brilliant
and smooth, as if it were put up but yes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">104</a></span>terday,
and, beyond the occasional falling of
a tile from the wonderful array of chimney-pots,
but little evidences are seen exteriorly
of its having decayed in the least. On the
tower which flanks the little door where one
meets the <i>concierge</i> and enters, there are unmistakable
marks of bullets and balls, which a
revolutionary or some other fury left as mementoes
of its passage.</p>

<p>Considering that Chambord was not a product
of feudal times, these disfigurements seem
out of place; still its peaceful motives could
hardly have been expected to have lasted always.</p>

<p>The southern façade is not excelled by the
elevation of any residential structure of any
age, and its outlines are varied and pleasing
enough to satisfy the most critical; if one pardons
the little pepper-boxes on the north and
south towers, and perforce one has to pardon
them when he recalls the magnificence of the
general disposition and sky-line of this marvellously
imposing château of the Renaissance.</p>

<p>François Premier made Chambord his favourite
residence, and in fact endowed Pierre
Nepveu&mdash;who for this work alone will be considered
one of the foremost architects of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">105</a></span>
French Renaissance&mdash;with the inspiration for
its erection in 1526.</p>

<div class="figright">
<img src="images/illus143_small.jpg" alt="Château de Chambord" title="Château de Chambord" />
<div class="caption"><a href="images/illus143.jpg"><i>Château de Chambord</i></a></div>
</div>



<p>A prodigious amount of sculpture by Jean
Cousin, Pierre Bontemps, Jean Goujon, and
Germain Pilon was interpolated above the
doorways and windows, in the framing thereof,
and above the great fireplaces. Inside and
out, above and below, were vast areas to be
covered, and François allowed his taste to have
full sway.</p>

<p>The presumptuous François made much of
this noble residence, perhaps because of his
love of <i>la chasse</i>, for game abounded hereabouts,
or perhaps because of his regard for
the Comtesse Thoury, who occupied a neighbouring
château.</p>

<p>For some time before his death, François
still lingered on at Chambord. Marguerite and
her brother, both now considerably aged since
the happier times of their childhood in Touraine,
always had an indissoluble fondness
for Chambord. Marguerite had now become
Queen of Navarre, but her beauty had been
dimmed with the march of time, and she no
longer was able to comfort and amuse her
kingly brother as of yore. His old pleasures
and topics of conversation irritated him, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">106</a></span>
he had even tired of poetry, art, and political
affairs.</p>

<p>Above all, he shamefully and shamelessly
abused women, at once the prop and the undermining
influence of his kingly power in days
gone by. There is an existing record to the
effect that he wrote some "window-pane"
verse on the window of his private apartment
to the following effect:</p>


<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i3">"Souvent femme varie;<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Mal habile quis'y fie!"<br /></span>
</div></div>


<p>If this be not apocryphal, the incident must
have taken place long years before that celebrated
"window-pane" verse of Shenstone's,
and François is proven again a forerunner, as
he was in many other things.</p>

<p>Without doubt the Revolution did away with
this square of glass, which&mdash;according to Piganiol
de la Force&mdash;existed in the middle of
the eighteenth century. Perhaps François's
own jealous humour prompted him to write
these cynical lines, and then again perhaps it
is merely one of those fables which breathe the
breath of life in some unaccountable manner,
no one having been present at its birth, and
hearsay and tradition accounting for it all.</p>

<p>François, truly, was failing, and he and his
sister discussed but sorrowful subjects: the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">107</a></span>
death of his favourite son, Charles, the inheritor
of the throne, at Abbeville, where he became
infected with the plague, and also the
death of him whom he called "his old friend,"
Henry VIII. of England, a monarch whose
amours were as numerous and celebrated as
his own.</p>

<p>Henri II. preferred the attractions of Anet
to Chambord, while Catherine de Medici and
Charles IX. cared more for Blois, Chaumont,
and Chenonceaux. Louis XIII. and Louis XIV.
only considered it as a rendezvous for the
chase, and the latter's successor, Louis XV.,
gave it to the illustrious Maurice de Saxe, the
victor of Fontenoy, who spent his old age here,
amid fêtes, pleasures, and military parades.
Near by are the barracks, built for the accommodation
of the regiment of horse formed by
the maréchal and devoted to his special guardianship
and pleasure, and paid for by the king,
who in turn repaid himself&mdash;with interest&mdash;from
the public treasury. The exercising of
this "little army" was one of the chief amusements
of the illustrious old soldier.</p>


<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i10">"A de feints combats<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lui-même en se jouant conduit les vieux soldats"&mdash;<br /></span>
</div></div>


<p>wrote the Abbé de Lille in contemporary times.</p>

<p>King Stanislas of Poland lived here from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">108</a></span>
1725 to 1733, and later it was given to Maréchal
Berthier, by whose widow it was sold in 1821.</p>

<p>It was bought by national subscription for
a million and a half of francs and given to
the Duc de Bordeaux, who immediately commenced
its restoration, for it had been horribly
mutilated by Maréchal de Saxe, and the surrounding
wood had been practically denuded
under the Berthier occupancy.</p>

<p>The Duc de Bordeaux died in 1883, and his
heirs, the Duc de Parme and the Comte de
Bardi, are now said to spend a quarter of a
million annually in the maintenance of the
estate, the income of which approximates only
half that sum.</p>

<p>There are thirteen great staircases in the
edifice, and a room for every day in the year.
On the ground floor is the Salle des Gardes,
from which one mounts by the great spiral to
another similar apartment with a barrel-vaulted
roof, which in a former day was converted
into a theatre, where in 1669-70 were
held the first representations of "Pourceaugnac"
and "Le Bourgeois Gentilhomme,"
and where Molière himself frequently appeared.</p>

<p>The second floor is known as the "<i>grandes
terrasses</i>" and surrounds the base of the great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">109</a></span>
central lantern so admired from the exterior.
On this floor, to the eastward, were the apartments
of François Premier. The chapel was
constructed by Henri II., but the tribune is of
the era of Louis XIV. This tribune is decorated
with a fine tapestry, made by Madame
Royale while imprisoned in the Temple. At the
base of the altar is also a tapestry made and
presented to the Comte de Chambord by the
women of the Limousin.</p>

<p>The apartments of Louis XIV. contain portraits
of Madame de Maintenon and Madame
de Lafayette, a great painting of the "Bataille
de Fontenoy," and another of the Comte de
Chambord on horseback.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">110</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER V.<span class="pagenum"><a href="#Contents">To ToC</a></span></h2>

<h4>CHEVERNY, BEAUREGARD, AND CHAUMONT</h4>


<p>From Chambord and its overpowering massiveness
one makes his way to Chaumont, on
the banks of the Loire below Blois, by easy
stages across the plain of the Sologne.</p>

<p>One leaves the precincts of Chambord by the
back entrance, as one might call it, through six
kilometres of forest road, like that by which
one enters, and soon passes the little townlet
of Bracieux.</p>

<p>One gets glimpses of more or less modern
residential châteaux once and again off the
main road, but no remarkably interesting
structures of any sort are met with until one
reaches Cheverny. Just before Cheverny one
passes Cour-Cheverny, with a curious old
church and a quaint-looking little inn beside it.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/illus151_small.jpg" alt="Château de Cheverny" title="Château de Cheverny" />
<div class="caption"><a href="images/illus151.jpg"><i>Château de Cheverny</i></a></div>
</div>



<p>Cheverny itself is, however, the real attraction,
two kilometres away. Here the château
is opened by its private owners from April to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">111</a></span>
October of each year, and, while not such a
grand establishment as many of its contemporaries
round about, it is in every way a perfect
residential edifice of the seventeenth century,
when the flowery and ornate Renaissance
had given way to something more severely
classical, and, truth to tell, far less pleasing
in an artistic sense.</p>

<p>Cheverny belongs to-day to the Marquis de
Vibraye, one of those undying titles of the
French nobility which thrive even in republican
France and uphold the best traditions of
the <i>noblesse</i> of other days.</p>

<p>The château was built much later than most
of the neighbouring châteaux, in 1634, by the
Comte de Cheverny, Philippe Hurault. It sits
green-swarded in the midst of a beautifully
wooded park, and the great avenue which faces
the principal entrance extends for seven kilometres,
a distance not excelled, if equalled, by
any private roadway elsewhere.</p>

<p>In its constructive features the château is
more or less of rectangular outlines. The pavilions
at each corner have their openings <i>à la
impériale</i>, with the domes, or lanterns, so customary
during the height of the style under
Louis XIV. An architect, Boyer by name, who
came from Blois, where surely he had the op<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">112</a></span>portunity
of having been well acquainted with
a more beautiful style, was responsible for the
design of the edifice at Cheverny.</p>

<p>The interior decorations in Cordovan leather,
the fine chimneypieces, and the many elaborate
historical pictures and wall paintings, by Mosnier,
Clouet, and Mignard, are all of the best
of their period; while the apartments themselves
are exceedingly ample, notably the Appartement
du Roi, furnished as it was in the
days of "Vert Galant," the Salle des Gardes,
the library and an elaborately traceried staircase.
In the chapel is an altar-table which
came from the Église St. Calais, in the château
at Blois.</p>

<p>Just outside the gates is a remarkable crotchety
old stone church, with a dwindling, toppling
spire. It is poor and impoverished when
compared with most French churches, and has
a most astonishing timbered veranda, with a
straining, creaking roof running around its two
unobstructed walls. The open rafters are filled
with all sorts of rubbish, and the local fire
brigade keeps its hose and ladders there. <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">113</a></span> A
most suitable old rookery it is in which to start
a first-class conflagration.</p>

<div class="figright">
<img src="images/illus155_small.jpg" alt="Cheverny-sur-Loire" title="Cheverny-sur-Loire" />
<div class="caption"><a href="images/illus155.jpg"><i>Cheverny-sur-Loire</i></a></div>
</div>

<p>Within are a few funeral marbles of the
Hurault family, and the daily offices are con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">114</a></span>ducted
with a pomp most unexpected. Altogether
it forms, as to its fabric and its functions,
as strong a contrast of activity and decay
as one is likely to see in a long journey.</p>

<p>The town itself is a sleepy, unprogressive
place, where automobilists may not even buy
<i>essence à pétrole</i>, and, though boasting&mdash;if
the indolent old town really does boast&mdash;a
couple of thousand souls, one still has to journey
to Cour-Cheverny to send a telegraphic
despatch or buy a daily paper.</p>

<p>Between Cheverny and Blois is the Forêt
de Russy, which will awaken memories of the
boar-hunts of François I., which, along with
art in all its enlightening aspects, appears to
have been one of the chief pleasures of that
monarch. Perhaps one ought to include also
the love of fair women, but with them he was
not so constant.</p>

<p>On the road to Blois, also, one passes the
Château de Beauregard; that is, one usually
passes it, but he shouldn't. It is built, practically,
within the forest, on the banks of the
little river Beauvron. An iron <i>grille</i> gives
entrance to a beautiful park, and within is the
château, its very name indicating the favour
with which it was held by its royal owner. It
was in 1520 that François I. established it as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">115</a></span>
a <i>rendezvous de chasse</i>. Under his son,
Henri II., it was reconstructed, in part; entirely
remodelled in the seventeenth century;
and "modernized"&mdash;whatever that may
mean&mdash;in 1809, and again, more lately, restored
by the Duc de Dino. It belongs to-day
to the Comte de Cholet, who has tried his hand
at "restoration" as well.</p>

<p>The history of this old château is thus seen
to have been most varied, and it is pretty sure
to have lost a good deal of its original character
in the transforming process.</p>

<p>The interior is more attractive than is the
exterior. There is a grand gallery of portraits
of historical celebrities, more than 350, executed
between 1617 and 1638 by Paul Ardier,
Counsellor of State, who thus combined the
accomplishment of the artist with the sagacity
of the statesman.</p>

<p>The ceilings of the great rooms are mostly
elaborate works in enamel and carved oak, and
there is a tiled floor (<i>carrelage</i>) in the portrait
gallery, in blue faïence, representing an army
in the order of battle, which must have delighted
the hearts of the youthful progeny who
may have been brought up within the walls of
the château. This pavement is moreover an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">116</a></span>
excellent example of the craftsmanship of tile-making.</p>

<p>One gains admission to the château freely
from the <i>concierge</i>, who in due course expects
her <i>pourboire</i>, and sees that she gets it. But
what would you, inquisitive traveller? You
have come here to see the sights, and Beauregard
is well worth the price of admission,
which is anything you like to give, certainly
not less than a franc.</p>

<p>One may return to Blois through the forest,
or may continue his way down the river to
Chaumont on the left bank.</p>

<p>At Chaumont the Loire broadens to nearly
double the width at Blois, its pebbles and sandbars
breaking the mirror-like surface into innumerable
pools and <i>étangs</i>. There is a bridge
which connects Chaumont with the railway at
Onzain and the great national highway from
Tours to Blois. The bridge, however, is so
hideous a thing that one had rather go miles
out of his way than accept its hospitality. It
is simply one of those unsympathetic wire-rope
affairs with which the face of the globe is being
covered, as engineering skill progresses and the
art instinct dies out.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/illus159_small.jpg" alt="Chaumont" title="Chaumont" />
<div class="caption"><a href="images/illus159.jpg"><i>Chaumont</i></a></div>
</div>



<p>The Château de Chaumont is charmingly
situated, albeit it is not very accessible to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">117</a></span>
strangers after one gets there, as it is open
to the public only on Thursdays, from July to
December. It is exactly what one expects to
find,&mdash;a fine riverside establishment of its
epoch, and in architectural style combining the
well-recognized features of late Gothic and the
early Renaissance. It is not moss-grown or
decrepit in any way, which fact, considering
its years, is perhaps remarkable.</p>

<p>The park of the château is only of moderate
extent, but the structure itself is, comparatively,
of much larger proportions. The ideal
view of the structure is obtained from midway
on that ungainly bridge which spans the Loire
at this point. Here, in the gold and purple
of an autumn evening, with the placid and far-reaching
Loire, its pools and its bars of sand
and pebble before one, it is a scene which is
as near idyllic as one is likely to see.</p>

<p>The town itself is not attractive; one long,
narrow lane-like street, lined on each side by
habitations neither imposing nor of a tumble-down
picturesqueness, borders the Loire.
There is nothing very picturesque, either, about
the homes of the vineyard workers round
about. Below and above the town the great
highroad runs flat and straight between Tours
and Blois on either side of the river, and auto<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">118</a></span>mobilists
and cyclists now roll along where the
state carriages of the court used to roll when
François Premier and his sons journeyed from
one gay country house to another.</p>

<p>It is to be inferred that the aspect of things
at Chaumont has not changed much since that
day,&mdash;always saving that spider-net wire
bridge. The population of the town has doubtless
grown somewhat, even though small towns
in France sometimes do not increase their
population in centuries; but the topographical
aspect of the long-drawn-out village, backed by
green hills on one side and the Loire on the
other, is much as it always has been.</p>

<div class="figright">
<img src="images/illus162_small.jpg" alt="Signature of Diane de Poitier" title="Signature of Diane de Poitier" />
<div class="caption"><i>Signature of Diane de Poitiers</i></div>
</div>

<p>The château at Chaumont had its origin as
far back as the tenth century, and its proprietors
were successively local seigneurs, Counts
of Blois, the family of Amboise, and Diane
de Poitiers, who received it from Catherine in
exchange for Chenonceaux. This was not a fair
exchange, and Diane was, to some extent,
justified in her complaints.</p>

<p>Chaumont was for a time in the possession<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">119</a></span>
of Scipion Sardini, one of the Italian partisans
of the Medici, "whose arms bore <i>trois sardines
d'argent</i>," and who had married Isabelle de la
Tour, "<i>la Demoiselle de Limieul</i>" of unsavoury
reputation.</p>

<p>The "<i>Demoiselle de Limieul</i>" was related,
too, to Catherine, and was celebrated in the
gallantries of the time in no enviable fashion.
She was a member of that band of demoiselles
whose business it was&mdash;by one fascination or
another&mdash;to worm political secrets from the
nobles of the court. One horrible scandal connected
the unfortunate lady with the Prince de
Condé, but it need not be repeated here. The
Huguenots ridiculed it in those memorable
verses beginning thus:</p>


<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i3">"Puella illa nobilis<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Quæ erat tam amabilis."<br /></span>
</div></div>


<p>After the reign of Sardini and of his direct
successors, the house of Bullion, Chaumont
passed through many hands. Madame de Staël
arrived at the château in the early years of the
nineteenth century, when she had received the
order to separate herself from Paris, "by at
least forty leagues." She had made the circle
of the outlying towns, hovering about Paris as
a moth about a candle-flame; Rouen, Auxerre,
Blois, Saumur, all had entertained her, but now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">120</a></span>
she came to establish herself in this Loire citadel.
As the story goes, journeying from Saumur
to Tours, by post-chaise, on the opposite
side of the river, she saw the imposing mass
of Chaumont rising high above the river-bed,
and by her good graces and winning ways installed
herself in the affections of the then proprietor,
M. Leray, and continued her residence
"and made her court here for many years."</p>

<p>Chaumont is to-day the property of the Princesse
de Broglie, who has sought to restore it,
where needful, even to reëstablishing the ancient
fosse or moat. This last, perhaps, is not
needful; still, a moated château, or even a
moated grange has a fascination for the sentimentally
inclined.</p>

<div>At the drawbridge, as one enters Chaumont
to-day, one sees the graven initials of Louis
XII. and Anne de Bretagne, the arms of
Georges d'Amboise, surmounted by his cardinal's
hat, and those of Charles de Chaumont,
as well as other cabalistic signs: one a representation
of a mountain (apparently) with a
crater-like summit from which flames are
breaking forth, while hovering about, back to
back, are two C's:
<img src="images/two_cs.jpg"
height="21" alt="Two C's back to back" title="" />. The Renaissance artists
greatly affected the rebus, and this perhaps
has some reference to the etymology of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">121</a></span>
the name Chaumont, which has been variously
given as coming from <i>Chaud Mont</i>, <i>Calvus
Mont</i>, and <i>Chauve Mont</i>.</div>



<p>Georges d'Amboise, the first of the name,
was born at Chaumont in 1460, the eighth son
of a family of seventeen children. It was a
far cry, as distances went in those days, from
the shores of the shallow, limpid Loire to those
of the forceful, turgent Seine at Rouen, where
in the great Cathedral of Notre Dame, this first
Georges of Amboise, having become an archbishop
and a cardinal, was laid to rest beneath
that magnificent canopied tomb before which
visitors to the Norman capital stand in wonder.
The mausoleum bears this epitaph, which in
some small measure describes the activities
of the man.</p>


<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i3">"Pastor eram cleri, populi pater; aurea sese<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Lilia subdebant, quercus et ipsa mihi.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i3">"Martuus en jaceo, morte extinguunter honores,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Et virtus, mortis nescia, mort viret."<br /></span>
</div></div>


<p>His was not by any means a life of placidity
and optimism, and he had the air and reputation
of doing things. There is a saying, still
current in Touraine: "<i>Laissez faire à
Georges.</i>"</p>

<p>The second of the same name, also an Arch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">122</a></span>bishop
of Rouen and a cardinal, succeeded his
uncle in the see. He also is buried beneath the
same canopy as his predecessor at Rouen.</p>

<p>The main portal of the château leads to a fine
quadrilateral court with an open gallery overlooking
the Loire, which must have been a magnificent
playground for the nobility of a
former day. The interior embellishments are
fine, some of the more noteworthy features
being a grand staircase of the style of
Louis XII.; the Salle des Gardes, with a
painted ceiling showing the arms of Chaumont
and Amboise; the Salle du Conseil, with some
fine tapestries and a remarkable tiled floor,
depicting scenes of the chase; the Chambre de
Catherine de Medici (she possessed Chaumont
for nine years), containing some of the gifts
presented to her upon her wedding with
Henri II.; and the curious Chambre de Ruggieri,
the astrologer whom Catherine brought
from her Italian home, and who was always
near her, and kept her supplied with charms
and omens, good and bad, and also her poisons.</p>

<p>Ruggieri's observatory was above his apartment.
It was at Chaumont that the astrologer
overstepped himself, and would have used his
magic against Charles IX. He did go so far
as to make an image and inflict certain indig<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">123</a></span>nities
upon it, with the belief that the same
would befall the monarch himself. Ruggieri
went to the galleys for this, but the scheming
Catherine soon had him out again, and at work
with his poisons and philtres.</p>

<p>Finally there is the Chambre de Diane de
Poitiers, Catherine's more than successful
rival, with a bed (modern, it is said) and a
series of sixteenth-century tapestries, with
various other pieces of contemporary furniture.
A portrait of Diane which decorates the
apartment is supposed to be one of the three
authentic portraits of the fair huntress. The
chapel has a fine tiled pavement and some
excellent glass.</p>

<p>Chaumont is eighteen kilometres from Blois
and the same distance from Amboise. It has
not the splendour of Chambord, but it has a
greater antiquity, and an incomparably finer
situation, which displays its coiffed towers and
their <i>mâchicoulis</i> and cornices in a manner not
otherwise possible. It is one of those picture
châteaux which tell a silent story quite independent
of guide-book or historical narrative.</p>

<p>It was M. Donatien Le Ray de Chaumont, the
superintendent of the forests of Berry and the
Blaisois, under Louis XVI., who gave hospitality
to Benjamin Franklin, and turned over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">124</a></span>
to the first American ambassador to France the
occupancy of his house at Passy, where Franklin
lived for nine consecutive years.</p>

<p>Of this same M. de Chaumont Americans cannot
have too high a regard, for his timely and
judicious hospitality has associated his name,
only less permanently than Franklin's, with
the early fortunes of the American republic.</p>

<p>Besides his other offices, M. de Chaumont was
the intendant of the Hôtel des Invalides, at
Paris, holding confidential relations with the
ministry of the young king, and was in the
immediate enjoyment of a fortune which
amounted to two and a half million of francs,
besides owning, in addition to Chaumont on
the Loire, another château in the Blaisois.
This château he afterward tendered to John
Adams, who declined the offer in a letter,
written at Passy-sur-Seine, February 25, 1779,
in the following words: "... To a mind as
much addicted to retirement as mine, the situation
you propose would be delicious indeed,
provided my country were at peace and my
family with me; but, separated from my
family and with a heart bleeding with the
wounds of its country, I should be the most
miserable being on earth...."</p>

<p>The potteries, which now form the stables<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">125</a></span>
of the château at Chaumont, are somewhat reminiscent
of Franklin. M. de Chaumont had
established a pottery here, where he had found
a clay which had encouraged him to hope that
he could compete with the English manufacturers
of the time. Here the Italian Nini, who
was invited to Chaumont, made medallions
much sought for by collectors, among others
one of Franklin, which was so much admired
as a work of art, and became so much in demand
that in later years replicas were made
and are well known to amateurs.</p>

<p>The family of Le Ray de Chaumont were
extensively known in America, where they became
large landholders in New York State in
the early nineteenth century, and the head of
the family seems to have been an amiable and
popular landlord. The towns of Rayville and
Chaumont in New York State still perpetuate
his name.</p>

<p>The two male members of the family secured
American wives; Le Ray himself married a
Miss Coxe, and their son a Miss Jahel, both of
New York.</p>

<p>From an anonymous letter to the New York
<i>Evening Post</i> of November 19, 1885, one quotes
the following:</p>

<p>"It was in Blois that I first rummaged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">126</a></span>
among these shops, whose attractions are almost
a rival to those of the castle, though this
is certainly one of the most interesting in
France. The traveller will remember the long
flight of stone steps which climbs the steep hill
in the centre of the town. Near the foot of this
hill there is a well-furnished book-shop; its
windows display old editions and rich bindings,
and tempt one to enter and inquire for antiquities.
Here I found a quantity of old notarial
documents and diplomas of college or university,
all more or less recently cleared out
from some town hall, or unearthed from neighbouring
castle, and sold by a careless owner,
as no longer valuable to him. This was the case
with most of the parchments I found at Blois;
they had been acquired within a few years from
the castle of Madon, and from a former proprietor
of the neighbouring castle of Chaumont
(the <i>calvus mons</i> of mediæval time), and most
of them pertained to the affairs of the <i>seigneurie
de Chaumont</i>. Contracts, executions,
sales of vineyards and houses, legal decisions,
<i>actes de vente</i>, loans on mortgages, the marriage
contract of a M. Lubin,&mdash;these were
the chief documents that I found and purchased."</p>

<p>The traveller may not expect to come upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">127</a></span>
duplicates of these treasures again, but the
incident only points to the fact that much documentary
history still lies more or less deeply
buried.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">128</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER VI.<span class="pagenum"><a href="#Contents">To ToC</a></span></h2>

<h4>TOURAINE: THE GARDEN SPOT OF FRANCE</h4>


<div class="poem"><div class="stanza center" >
<span class="i0_5">"C'est une grande dame, une princesse altière,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Chacun de ses châteaux, marqué du sceau royal,<br /></span>

</div></div>



<p>It is difficult to write appreciatively of Touraine
without echoing the words of some one
who has gone before, and it is likely that those
who come after will find the task no easier.</p>

<p>Truly, as a seventeenth-century geographer
has said: "Here is the most delicious and the
most agreeable province of the kingdom. It
has been named the garden of France because
of the softness of its climate, the affability of
its people, and the ease of its life."</p>

<p>The poets who have sung the praises of Touraine
are many, Ronsard, Remy Belleau, Du
Bellay, and for prose authors we have at the
head, Rabelais, La Fontaine, Balzac, and Alfred
de Vigny. Merely to enumerate them all would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">129</a></span>
be impossible, but they furnish a fund of quotable
material for the traveller when he is writing
home, and are equally useful to the maker
of guide-books.</p>

<p>One false note on Touraine, only, has ever
rung out in the world of literature, and that
was from Stendahl, who said: "<i>La Belle Touraine
n'existe pas!</i>" The pages of Alfred de
Vigny and Balzac answer this emphatically,
and to the contrary, and every returning traveller
apparently sides with them and not with
Stendahl.</p>

<p>How can one not love its prairies, gently
sloping to the caressing Loire, its rolling hills
and dainty ravines? The broad blue Loire is
always vague and tranquil here, at least one
seems always to see it so, but the beauty of
Touraine is, after all, a quiet beauty which must
be seen to be appreciated, and lived with to
be loved.</p>

<p>It is a land of most singular attractions,
neither too hot nor too cold, too dry nor too
damp, with a sufficiency of rain, and an abundance
of sunshine. Its market-gardens are
prolific in their product, its orchards overflowing
with plenitude, and its vineyards generous
in their harvest.</p>

<p>Touraine is truly the region where one may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">130</a></span>
read history without books, with the very pages
of nature punctuated and adorned with the
marvels of the French Renaissance. Louis XI.
gave the first impetus to the alliance of the
great domestic edifice&mdash;which we have come
to distinguish as the residential château&mdash;with
the throne, and the idea was amplified
by Charles VIII. and glorified by François
Premier.</p>

<p>In the brilliant, if dissolute, times of the
early sixteenth century François Premier and
his court travelled down through this same
Touraine to Loches and to Amboise, where
François's late gaoler, Charles Quint, was to
be received and entertained. It was after
François had returned from his involuntary
exile in Spain, and while he was still in residence
at the Louvre, that the plans for
the journey were made. To the Duchesse
d'Étampes François said,&mdash;the duchess who
was already more than a rival of both Diane
and the Comtesse de Châteaubriant,&mdash;"I must
tear myself away from you to-morrow. I shall
await my brother Charles at Amboise on the
Loire."</p>

<p>"Shall you not revenge yourself upon him,
for his cruel treatment of you?" said the wily
favourite of the time. "If he, like a fool,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">131</a></span>
comes to Touraine, will you not make him revoke
the treaty of Madrid or shut him up in one
of Louis XI.'s oubliettes?"</p>

<p>"I will persuade him, if possible," said
François, "but I shall never force him."</p>

<p>In due time François did receive his brother
king at Amboise and it was amid great ceremony
and splendour. His guest could not, or
would not, mount steps, so that great inclined
plane, up which a state coach and its horses
might go, was built. Probably there was a
good reason for the emperor's peculiarity, for
that worthy or unworthy monarch finally died
of gout in the monastery of San Juste.</p>

<p>The meeting here at Amboise was a grand
and ceremonious affair and the Spanish monarch
soon came to recognize a possible enemy
in the royal favourite, Anne de Pisselieu. The
emperor's eyes, however, melted with admiration,
and he told her that only in France could
one see such a perfection of elegance and
beauty, with the result that&mdash;as is popularly
adduced&mdash;the susceptible, ambitious, and unfaithful
duchess betrayed François more than
once in the affairs attendant upon the subsequent
wars between France, England, and
Spain.</p>

<p>From Touraine, in the sixteenth century,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">132</a></span>
spread that influence which left its impress
even on the capital of the kingdom itself, not
only in respect to architectural art, but in
manners and customs as well.</p>

<p>Whatever may be the real value of the
Renaissance as an artistic expression, the discussion
of it shall have no place here, beyond
the qualifying statement that what we have
come to know as the French Renaissance&mdash;which
undeniably grew up from a transplanted
Italian germ&mdash;proved highly tempting to the
mediæval builder for all manner of edifices,
whereas it were better if it had been confined
to civic and domestic establishments and left
the church pure in its full-blown Gothic forms.</p>

<p>Curiously enough, here in Touraine, this is
just what did happen. The Renaissance influence
crept into church-building here and
there&mdash;and it is but a short step from the
"<i>gothique rayonnant</i>" to what are recognized
as well-defined Renaissance features; but it is
more particularly in respect to the great châteaux,
and even smaller dwellings, that the
superimposed Italian details were used. A
notable illustration of this is seen in the Cathedral
of St. Gatien at Tours. It is very beautiful
and has some admirable Gothic features,
but there are occasional constructive details, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">133</a></span>
well as those for decorative effect alone, which
are decidedly not good Gothic; but, as they
are, likewise, not Renaissance, they hence cannot
be laid to its door, but rather to the architect's
eccentricity.</p>

<p>In the smaller wayside churches, such as one
sees at Cormery, at Cheverny, and at Cour-Cheverny,
there is scarcely a sign of Renaissance,
while their neighbouring châteaux are
nothing else, both in construction and in decoration.</p>

<p>The Château de Langeais is, for the most
part, excellent Gothic, and so is the church
near by. Loches has distinct and pure Gothic
details both in its church and its château, quite
apart from the Hôtel de Ville and that portion
of the château now used as the Sous-Préfecture,
which are manifestly Renaissance; hence here
in Touraine steps were apparently taken to
keep the style strictly non-ecclesiastical.</p>

<p>A glance of the eye at the topography of this
fair province stamps it at once as something
quite different from any other traversed by the
Loire. Two of the great "routes nationales"
cross it, the one via Orleans, leading to Nantes,
and the other via Chartres, going to Bordeaux.
It is crossed and recrossed by innumerable
"routes secondaires," "départementales,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">134</a></span>
"vicinales" and "particulières," second to
none of their respective classes in other countries,
for assuredly the roads of France are
the best in the world. Many of these great
ways of communication replaced the ancient
Roman roads, which were the pioneers of the
magnificent roadways of the France of to-day.</p>

<p>Almost invariably Touraine is flat or rolling,
its highest elevation above the sea being but a
hundred and forty-six metres, scarce four hundred
and fifty feet, a fact which accounts also
for the gentle flow of the Loire through these
parts.</p>

<p>All the fruits of the southland are found
here, the olive alone excepted. Mortality, it is
said, and proved by figures, is lower than in
any other part of France, and for this reason
many dwellers in the large cities, if they may
not all have a mediæval château, have at least
a villa, far away from "the madding crowd,"
and yet within four hours' travel of the capital
itself.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<a href="images/illus179.jpg">
<img src="images/illus179_small.jpg" alt="The Loire in Touraine" title="The Loire in Touraine" />
</a></div>

<p>Touraine, properly speaking, has no natural
frontiers, as it is not enclosed by rivers or
mountains. It is, however, divided by the
Loire into two distinct regions, the Méridionale
and the Septentrionale; but the dress, the
physiognomy, the language, and the predilec<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">135</a></span>tions
of the people are everywhere the same,
though the two sections differ somewhat in
temperament. In the south, the Tourangeau
is timid and obliging, but more or less engrossed
in his affairs; in the north, he is
proud, egotistical, and a little arrogant, but,
above all, he likes his ease and comfort, something
after the manner of "mynheer" of Holland.</p>

<p>These are the characteristics which are
enumerated by Stanislas Bellanger of Tours,
in "La Touraine Ancienne et Moderne," and
they are traceable to-day, in every particular,
to one who knows well the by-paths of the
region.</p>

<p>Formerly the peasant was, in his own words,
"<i>sous la main de M. le comte</i>," but, with the
coming of the eighteenth century, all this was
changed, and the conditions which, in England,
succeeded feudalism, are unknown in Touraine,
as indeed throughout France.</p>

<p>The two great divisions which nature had
made of Touraine were further cut up into
five <i>petits pays</i>; les Varennes, le Veron, la
Champeigne, la Brenne, and les Gâtines;
names which exist on some maps to-day, but
which have lost, in a great measure, their
former distinction.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">136</a></span></p>

<p>There is a good deal to be said in favour of
the physical and moral characteristics of the
inhabitants of Touraine. Just as the descendants
of the Phoceans, the original settlers of
Marseilles, differ from the natives of other
parts of France, so, too, do the Tourangeaux
differ from the inhabitants of other provinces.
The people of Touraine are a mixture of Romans,
Visigoths, Saracens, Alains, Normans
and Bretons, Anglais and Gaulois; but all have
gradually been influenced by local conditions,
so that the native of Touraine has become a
distinct variety all by himself. The deliciousness
of the "garden of France" has altered
him so that he stands to-day as more distinctly
French than the citizen of Paris itself.</p>

<p>Touraine, too, has the reputation of being
that part of France where is spoken the purest
French. This, perhaps, is as true of the Blaisois,
for the local bookseller at Blois will tell
one with the most dulcet and understandable
enunciation that it is at Blois that one hears
the best accent. At any rate, it is something
found within a charmed circle, of perhaps a
hundred miles in diameter, that does not find
its exact counterpart elsewhere. As Seville
stands for the Spanish tongue, Florence for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">137</a></span>
the Italian, and Dresden for the German, so
Tours stands for the French.</p>

<p>The history of the Loire in Touraine, as is
the case at Le Puy, at Nevers, at Sancerre, or
at Orleans, is abundant and vivid, and the
monuments which line its banks are numerous
and varied, from the fortress-château of Amboise
to the Cathedral of St. Gatien at Tours
with its magnificent bejewelled façade. The
ruined towers of the castle of Cinq-Mars, with
its still more ancient Roman "pile," and the
feudal châteaux of the countryside are all eloquent,
even to-day, in their appeal to all lovers
of history and romance.</p>

<p>There are some verses, little known, in praise
of the Loire, as it comes through Touraine,
written by Houdon des Landes, who lived
near Tours in the eighteenth century. The following
selection expresses their quality well
and is certainly worthy to rank with the best
that Balzac wrote in praise of his beloved Touraine.</p>


<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i3">"La Loire enorgueillit ses antiques cités,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Et courounne ses bords de coteaux enchantés;<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Dans ses vallons heureux, sur ses rives aimées,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Les prés ont déployé leurs robes parfumées;<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Le saule humide et souple y lance ses rameaux.<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Ses coteaux sont peuplés, et le rocher docile<br /></span>
<span class="i4">A l'homme qui le creuse offre un champêtre asile.<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">138</a></span>

<span class="i4">Sur tes bords fortunés naquirent, et la gloire<br /></span>
<span class="i4">A l'une dût l'amour, à l'autre la victoire."<br /></span>
</div></div>


<p>Again and again Balzac's words echo in
one's ears from his "Scène de la Vie de Province."
The following quotations are typical
of the whole:</p>

<p>"The softness of the air, the beauty of the
climate, all tend to a certain ease of existence
and simplicity of manner which encourages an
appreciation of the arts."</p>

<p>"Touraine is a land to foster the ambition
of a Napoleon and the sentiment of a Byron."</p>

<p>Another writer, A. Beaufort, a publicist of
the nineteenth century, wrote:</p>

<p>"The Tourangeaux resemble the good Adam
in the garden of Eden. They drink, they eat,
they sleep and dream, and care not what their
neighbour may be doing."</p>

<p>Touraine was indeed, at one time, a veritable
Eden, though guarded by fortresses, <i>hallebardes</i>,
and arquebuses, but not the less an
Eden for all that. In addition it was a land
where, in the middle ages, the seigneurs made
history, almost without a parallel in France or
elsewhere.</p>

<p>Touraine, truly enough, was the centre of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">139</a></span>
old French monarchy in the perfection of its
pomp and state; but it is also true that Touraine
knew little of the serious affairs of kings,
though some all-important results came from
events happening within its borders.</p>

<p>Paris was the law-making centre in the sixteenth
century, and Touraine knew only the
domestic life and pleasures of royalty. Etiquette,
form, and ceremony were all relaxed,
or at least greatly modified, and the court spent
in the country what it had levied in the capital.</p>

<p>Curiously enough, the monarchs were omnipotent
and influential here, though immediately
they quartered themselves in Paris their
powers waned considerably; indeed, they
seemed to lose their influence upon ministers
and vassals alike.</p>

<p>Louis XIII., it is true, tried to believe that
Paris was France,&mdash;like the Anglo-Saxon tourists
who descend upon it in such great numbers
to-day,&mdash;and built Versailles; but there was
never much real glory about its cold and pompous
walls.</p>

<p>The fortunes of the old châteaux of Touraine
have been most varied. Chambord is vast and
bare, elegant and pompous; Blois, just across
the border, is a tourist sight of the first rank
whose salamanders and porcupines have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">140</a></span>
well cared for by the paternal French government.
Chaumont, Chenonceaux, Langeais,
Azay-le-Rideau, and half a dozen others are
still inhabited, and are gay with the life of
twentieth-century luxury; Amboise is a possession
of the Orleans family; Loches is, in
part, given over to the uses of a sous-préfecture;
and Chinon's châteaux are but half-demolished
ruins. Besides these there are numerous
smaller residential châteaux of the
nobility scattered here and there in the Loire
watershed.</p>

<p>There have been writers who have sought to
commiserate with "the poor peasant of Touraine,"
as they have been pleased to think of
him, and have deplored the fact that his sole
possession was a small piece of ground which
he and his household cultivated, and that he
lived in a little whitewashed house, built with
his own hands, or those of his ancestors.
Though the peasant of Touraine, as well as of
other parts of the countryside, works for an
absurdly small sum, and for considerably less
than his brother nearer Paris, he sells his produce
at the nearest market-town for a fair
price, and preserves a spirit of independence
which is as valuable as are some of the things
which are thrust upon him in some other lands<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">141</a></span>
under the guise of benevolent charity, really
patronage of a most demeaning and un-moral
sort. At night the Touraine peasant returns
to his own hearthstone conscious that he is a
man like all of his fellows, and is not a mere
atom ground between the upper and nether
millstones of the landlord and the squire. He
cooks his "<i>bouillie</i>" over three small sticks
and retires to rest with the fond hope that on
the next market-day following the prices of
eggs, chickens, cauliflowers, or tomatoes may
be higher. He is the stuff that successful citizens
are made of, and is not to be pitied in the
least, even though it is only the hundredth man
of his community who ever does rise to more
wealth than a mere competency.</p>

<p>Touraine, rightly enough, has been called the
garden of France, but it is more than that,
much more; it is a warm, soft land where all
products of the soil take on almost a subtropical
luxuriance. Besides the great valley of the
Loire, there are the valleys of the tributaries
which run into it, in Touraine and the immediate
neighbourhood, all of which are fertile
as only a river-bottom can be. It is true that
there are numerous formerly arid and sandy
plateaux, quite unlike the abundant plains of
La Beauce, though to-day, by care and skill,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">142</a></span>
they have been made to rival the rest of the
region in productiveness.</p>

<p>The Département d'Indre et Loire is the
richest agricultural region in all France so far
as the variety and abundance of its product
goes, rivalling in every way the opulence of
the Burgundian hillsides. Above all, Touraine
stands at the head of the vine-culture of all the
Loire valley, the <i>territoire vinicole</i> lapping
over into Anjou, where are produced the celebrated
<i>vins blancs</i> of Saumur.</p>

<p>The vineyard workers of Touraine, in the
neighbourhood of Loches, have clung closely
to ancient customs, almost, one may say, to the
destruction of the industry, though of late new
methods have set in, and, since the blight now
some years gone by, a new prosperity has come.</p>

<p>The day worker, who cares for the vines and
superintends the picking of the grapes by the
womenfolk and the children, works for two
francs fifty centimes per day; but he invariably
carries with him to the scene of his labours
a couple of cutlets from a young and juicy
<i>brebis</i>, or even a <i>poulet rôti</i>, so one may judge
from this that his pay is ample for his needs
in this land of plenty.</p>

</div>

<p>In the morning he takes his bowl of soup and
a cup of white wine, and of course huge hunks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">143</a></span>
of bread, and finally coffee, and on each Sunday
he has his <i>rôti à la maison</i>. All this demonstrates
the fact that the French peasant is more
of a meat eater in these parts than he is commonly
thought to be.</p>

<p>Touraine has no peculiar beauties to offer
the visitor; there is nothing <i>outré</i> about it to
interest one; but, rather, it wins by sheer
charm alone, or perhaps a combination of
charms and excellencies makes it so truly a
delectable land.</p>

<p>The Tourangeaux themselves will tell you,
when speaking of Rabelais and Balzac, that it
is the land of "<i>haute graisse, féconde et spirituelle</i>."
It is all this, and, besides its spirituelle
components, it will supply some very real
and substantial comforts. It is the Eden of the
gourmandiser of such delicacies as <i>truffes</i>,
<i>rilettes</i>, and above all, <i>pruneaux</i>, which you get
in one form or another at nearly every meal.
Most of the good things of life await one here
in abundance, with kitchen-gardens and vineyards
at every one's back door. Truly Touraine
is a land of good living.</p>

<p>Life runs its course in Touraine, "<i>facile
et bonne</i>," without any extremes of joy or sorrow,
without chimerical desires or infinite despair,
and the agreeable sensations of life pre<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">144</a></span>dominate,&mdash;the
first essential to real happiness.</p>

<p>Some one has said, and certainly not without
reason, that every Frenchman has a touch
of Rabelais and of Voltaire in his make-up.
This is probably true, for France has never
been swept by a wave of puritanism such as
has been manifest in most other countries, and
<i>le gros rire</i> is still the national philosophy.</p>

<p>In a former day a hearty laugh, or at least
an amused cynicism, diverted the mind of the
martyr from threatened torture and even violent
death. Brinvilliers laughed at those who
were to torture her to death, and De la Barre
and Danton cracked jokes and improvised puns
upon the very edge of their untimely graves.</p>

<p>Touraine has the reputation of being a wonderfully
productive field for the book collector,
though with books, like many other treasures
of a past time, the day has passed when one
may "pick up" for two sous a MS. worth
as many thousands of francs; but still bargains
are even now found, and if one wants great
calf-covered tomes, filled with fine old engravings,
bearing on the local history of the <i>pays</i>,
he can generally find them at all prices here in
old Touraine.</p>

<p>There was a more or less apocryphal story<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">145</a></span>
told us and the landlady of our inn concerning
a find which a guest had come upon in a little
roadside hamlet at which he chanced to stop.
He was one of those omnipresent <i>commis voyageurs</i>
who thread the French provinces up
and down, as no other country in the world is
"travelled" or "drummed." He was the
representative for a brandy shipper, one of
those substantial houses of the cognac region
whose product is mostly sold only in France;
but this fact need not necessarily put the individual
very far down in the social scale. Indeed,
he was a most amiable and cultivated
person.</p>

<p>Our fellow traveller had come to a village
where all the available accommodations of the
solitary inn were already engaged; therefore
he was obliged to put up with a room in the
town, which the landlord hunted out for him.
Repairing to his room without any thought save
that of sleep, the traveller woke the next morning
to find the sun streaming through the
opaqueness of a brilliantly coloured window.
Not stained glass here, surely, thought the
stranger, for his lodging was a most humble
one. It proved to be not glass at all; merely
four great vellum leaves, taken from some ancient
tome and stuck into the window-framing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">146</a></span>
where the glass ought to have been. Daylight
was filtering dimly through the rich colouring,
and it took but a moment to become convinced
that the sheets were something rare and valuable.
He learned that the pages were from an
old Latin MS., and that the occupant of the little
dwelling had used "<i>the paper</i>" in the place
of the glass which had long since disappeared.
The vellum and its illuminations had stood the
weather well, though somewhat dimmed in comparison
with the brilliancy of the remaining
folios, which were found below-stairs. There
were in all some eighty pages, which were purchased
for a modest forty sous, and everybody
satisfied.</p>

<p>The volume had originally been found by
the father of the old dame who then had possession
of it in an old château in revolutionary
times. Whether her honoured parent was a
pillager or a protector did not come out, but
for all these years the possession of this fine
work meant no more to this Tourangelle than
a supply of "paper" for stopping up broken
window-panes.</p>

<p>"She parted readily enough with the remaining
leaves," said our Frenchman, "but nothing
would induce her to remove those which
filled the window." "No, we have no more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">147</a></span>
glass, and these have answered quite well for
a long time now," she said. And such is the
simplicity of the French provincial, even to-day&mdash;<i>sometimes</i>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">148</a></span></p>

<h4>AMBOISE</h4>


<p>As one approaches Amboise, he leaves the
comparatively insalubrious plain of the Sologne
and the Blaisois and enters Touraine.</p>

<p>Amboise! What history has been made
there; what a wealth of action its memories
recall, and what splendour, gaiety, and sadness
its walls have held! An entire book might be
written about the scenes which took place under
its roof.</p>

<p>To-day most travellers are content to rush
over its apartments, gaze at its great round
tower, view the Loire, which is here quite at
its best, from the battlements, and, after a brief
admiration of the wonderfully sculptured portal
of its chapel, make their way to Chenonceaux,
or to the gay little metropolis of Tours.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/illus197_small.jpg" alt="Château d'Amboise" title="Château d'Amboise" />
<div class="caption"><a href="images/illus197.jpg"> <i>Château d'Amboise</i></a></div>
</div>

<p>No matter whither one turns his steps from
Amboise, he will not soon forget this great fortress-château
and the memories of the <i>petite
bande</i> of blondes and brunettes who followed
in the wake of François Premier.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">149</a></span></p>

<p>Here, and at Blois, the recollections of this
little band are strong in the minds of students
of romance and history. Some one has said
that along the corridors of Amboise one still
may meet the wraiths of those who in former
days went airily from one pleasure to another,
but this of course depends upon the mood and
sentiment of the visitor.</p>

<p>Amboise has a very good imitation of the
climate of the south, and the glitter of the Loire
at midday in June is about as torrid a picture
as one can paint in a northern clime. It is not
that it is so very hot in degree, but that the
lack of shade-trees along its quays gives Amboise
a shimmering resemblance to a much
warmer place than it really is. The Loire is
none too ample here, and frets its way, as it
does through most of its lower course, through
banks of sand and pebbles in a more or less
vain effort to look cool.</p>

<p>Amboise is old, for, under the name of Ambatia,
it existed in the fourth century, at which
epoch St. Martin, the patron of Tours, threw
down a pagan pyramidal temple here and established
Christianity; and Clovis and Alaric
held their celebrated meeting on the Ile St.
Jean in 496. It was not long after this, according
to the ancient writers, that some sort<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">150</a></span>
of a fortified château took form here. Louis-le-Bègue
gave Amboise to the Counts of Anjou,
and Hughes united the two independent seigneuries
of the château and the bourg. After
the Counts of Anjou succeeded the Counts of
Berry, Charles VII., by appropriation, confiscation,
seizure, or whatever you please to call
it,&mdash;history is vague as to the real motive,&mdash;united
Amboise to the possessions of the Crown
in 1434. Louis XI. lived for a time at this
strong fortress-château, before he turned his
affections so devotedly to Plessis-les-Tours.
Charles VIII. was born and died here, and it
was he who added the Renaissance details, or
at least the first of them, upon his return from
Italy. Indeed, it is to him and to the nobles
who followed in his train during his Italian
travels that the introduction of the Renaissance
into France is commonly attributed.</p>

<p>It was at Amboise that Charles VIII., forgetful
of the miseries of his Italian campaign, set
about affairs of state with a renewed will and
vigour. He was personally superintending
some alterations in the old castle walls, and
instructing the workmen whom he brought
from Italy with him as to just how far they
might introduce those details which the world
has come to know as Renaissance, when, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">151</a></span>
passing beneath a low overhanging beam, he
struck his head so violently that he expired
almost immediately (April 17, 1498).</p>

<p>Louis XII., the superstitious, lived here for
some time, and here occurred some of the most
important events in the life of the great François,
the real popularizer of the new architectural
Renaissance.</p>

<p>It was in the old castle of Amboise, the early
home of Louis XII., that his appointed successor,
his son-in-law and second cousin, François,
was brought up. Here he was educated by his
mother, Louise de Savoie, Duchesse d'Angoulême,
together with that bright and shining
light, that Marguerite who was known as the
"Pearl of the Valois," poetess, artist, and
court intriguer. Here the household formed
what in the early days François himself was
pleased to call a "trinity of love."</p>

<p>Throughout the structure may yet be seen
the suggestions of François's artistic instincts,
traced in the window-framings of the façade,
in the interior decorations of the long gallery,
and on the terrace hanging high above the
Loire.</p>

<p>In the park and in the surrounding forest
François and his sister Marguerite passed
many happy days of their childhood. Mar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">152</a></span>guerite,
who had already become known as the
"tenth muse," had already thought out her
"Heptameron," whilst François tried his
prentice hand at love-rhyming, an expression
of sentiment which at a later period took the
form of avowals in person to his favourites.</p>

<p>One recalls those stanzas to the memory of
Agnes Sorel, beginning:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i3">"Gentille Agnès plus de loz tu mérite,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">La cause était de France recouvrir;<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Que ce que peut dedans un cloître ouvrir<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Close nonnaine? ou bien dévot hermite?"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>François was more than a lover of the beautiful.
His appreciation of architectural art
amounted almost to a passion, and one might
well claim him as a member of the architectural
guild, although, in truth, he was nothing more
than a generous patron of the craftsmen of his
day.</p>

<p>François was the real father of the French
Renaissance, the more splendid flower which
grew from the Italian stalk. He had no liking
for the Van Eycks and Holbeins of the Dutch
school, reserving his favour for the frankly
languid masters from the south. He brought
from Italy Cellini, Primaticcio, and the great
Leonardo, who it is said had a hand in that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">153</a></span>
wonderful shell-like spiral stairway in the château
at Blois.</p>

<p>By just what means Da Vinci was inveigled
from Italy will probably never be known. The
art-loving François visited Milan, and among
its curiosities was shown the even then celebrated
"Last Supper" of Leonardo. The
next we know is that, "<i>François repasse les
Alpes ayant avec lui Mon Sieur Lyonard, son
peintre</i>." Leonardo was given a pension of
seven <i>ecus de France</i> per year and a residence
near Amboise. Vasari recounts very precisely
how Leonardo expired in the arms of his kingly
patron at Amboise, but on the other hand, the
court chronicles have said that François was
at St. Germain on that day. Be this as it may,
the intimacy was a close one, and we may be
sure that François felt keenly the demise of this
most celebrated painter of his court.</p>

<p>It was during those early idyllic days at
Amboise that the character of François was
formed, and the marvel is that the noble and
endearing qualities did not exceed the baser
ones. To be sure his after lot was hard, and
his real and fancied troubles many, and they
were not made the less easy to bear because
of his numerous female advisers.</p>

<p>In his youth at Amboise his passions still<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">154</a></span>
slumbered, but when they did awaken, they
burst forth with an unquenchable fury. Meantime
he was working off any excess of imagination
by boar-hunts and falconry in the neighbouring
forest of Chanteloup, and had more
than one hand-to-hand affray with resentful
citizens of the town, when he encroached upon
what they considered their traditional preserves.
So he grew to man's estate, but the
life that he lived in his youth under the kingly
roof of the château at Amboise gave him the
benefits of all the loyalty which his fellows
knew, and it helped him carry out the ideas
which were bequeathed to him by his uncle.</p>

<p>It was at a sitting of the court at Amboise,
when François was still under his mother's
wing,&mdash;at the age of twenty only,&mdash;that the
Bourbon affair finally came to its head. Many
notables were mixed up in it as partisans of
the ungrateful and ambitious Bourbon, Charles
de Montpensier, Connétable de France. It was
an office only next in power to that of the sovereign
himself, and one which had been allowed
to die out in the reign of Louis XI. The final
outcome of it all was that François became a
prisoner at Pavia, through the treachery of the
Connétable and his followers, who went over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">155</a></span>
<i>en masse</i> to François's rival, Charles V., who,
as Charles II., was King of Spain.</p>

<p>Of the subsequent meeting with the Emperor
Charles on French soil, François said to the
Duchesse d'Étampes: "It is with regret that
I leave you to meet the emperor at Amboise
on the Loire." And he added: "You will follow
me with the queen." His queen at this
time was poor Eleanor of Portugal, herself a
Spanish princess, Claude of France, his first
wife, having died. "These two," says Brantôme,
"were the only virtuous women of his
household."</p>

<p>The Emperor Charles was visibly affected
by the meeting, though, it is true, he had no
love for his old enemy, François. Perhaps it
was on account of the duchess, for whom
François had put aside Diane. At any rate,
the emperor was gallant enough to say to her:
"It is only in France that I have seen such
a perfection of elegance and beauty. My
brother, your king, should be the envy of all
the sovereigns of Europe. Had I such a captive
at my palace in Madrid, there were no
ransom that I would accept for her."</p>

<p>François cared not for the lonely Spanish
princess whom he had made his queen; but
he was somewhat susceptible to the charms of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">156</a></span>
his daughter-in-law, Catherine de Medici, the
wife of his son Henri, who, when at Amboise,
was his ever ready companion in the chase.</p>

<p>François was inordinately fond of the hunt,
and made of it a most strenuous pastime, full
of danger and of hard riding in search of the
boar and the wolf, which abounded in the thick
underwood in the neighbourhood. One wonders
where they, or, rather, their descendants,
have disappeared, since nought in these days
but a frightened hare, a partridge, or perhaps
a timid deer ever crosses one's path, as he
makes his way by the smooth roads which cross
and recross the forest behind Amboise.</p>

<p>When François II. was sixteen he became
the nominal king of France. To Amboise he
and his young bride came, having been brought
thither from Blois, for fear of the Huguenot
rising. The court settled itself forthwith at
Amboise, where the majestic feudal castle piled
itself high up above the broad, limpid Loire,
feeling comparatively secure within the protection
of its walls. Here the Loire had widened
to the pretensions of a lake, the river being
spanned by a bridge, which crossed it by the
help of the island, as it does to-day.</p>

<p>Over this old stone bridge the court approached
the castle, the retinue brilliant with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">157</a></span>
all the trappings of a luxurious age, archers,
pages, and men-at-arms. The king and his
new-found bride, the winsome Mary Stuart,
rode well in the van. In their train were Catherine,
the "queen-mother" of three kings, the
Cardinal de Lorraine, the Duc de Guise, the
Duc de Nemours, and a vast multitude of gay
retainers, who were moved about from place
to place like pawns upon the chess-board, and
with about as much consideration.</p>

<p>The gentle Mary Stuart, born in 1542, at
Linlithgow, in stern Caledonia, of a French
mother,&mdash;Marie de Lorraine,&mdash;was doomed
to misfortune, for her father, the noble
James V., prophesied upon his death-bed that
the dynasty would end with his daughter.</p>

<p>At the tender age of five Mary was sent to
France and placed in a convent. Her education
was afterward continued at court under the
direction of her uncle, the Cardinal de Lorraine.
By ten she had become well versed in
French, Latin, and Italian, and at one time,
according to Brantôme, she gave a discourse
on literature and the liberal arts&mdash;so flourishing
at the time&mdash;before the king and his court.
Ronsard was her tutor in versification, which
became one of her favourite pursuits.</p>

<p>Mary Stuart's charms were many. She was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">158</a></span>
tall and finely formed, with auburn hair shining
like an aureole above her intellectual forehead,
and with a skin of such dazzling whiteness&mdash;a
trite saying, but one which is used
by Brantôme&mdash;"that it outrivalled the whiteness
of her veil."</p>

<p>In the spring of 1558, when she was but sixteen,
Mary Stuart was married to the Dauphin,
the weak, sickly François II., himself but a
youth. He was, however, sincerely and deeply
fond of his young wife.</p>

<p>Unexpectedly, through the death of Henri II.
at the hands of Montgomery at that ever debatable
tournament, François II. ascended the
throne of France, and Mary Stuart saw herself
exalted to the dizzy height which she had not
so soon expected. She became the queen of two
kingdoms, and, had the future been more propitious,
the whole map of Europe might have
been changed.</p>

<p>Disease had marked the unstable François
for its own, and within a year he passed from
the throne to the grave, leaving his young
queen a widow and an orphan.</p>

<p>Shortly afterward "<i>la reine blanche</i>" returned
to her native Scotland, bidding France
that long, last, sad adieu so often quoted:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">159</a></span></p>


<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i3">"Farewell, beloved France, to thee!<br /></span>

</div></div>


<p>The young sovereigns had had a most stately
suite of apartments prepared for them at Amboise,
the lofty windows reaching from floor
to ceiling and overlooking the river and the
vast terrace where was so soon to be enacted
that bloody drama to which they were to be
made unwilling witnesses.</p>

<p>This gallery was wainscoted with old oak
and hung with rich leathers, and the lofty ceiling
was emblazoned with heraldic emblems and
monograms, as was the fashion of the day.
Brocades and tapestries, set in great gold
frames, lined the walls, and, in a boudoir or
retiring-room beyond, still definitely to be recognized,
was a remarkable series of embroidered
wall decorations, a tapestry of flowers
and fruits with an arabesque border of white
and gold, truly a queenly apartment, and one
that well became the luxurious and dainty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">160</a></span>
Mary, who came from Scotland to marry the
youthful François.</p>

<p>Mary Stuart knew little at the time as to
why they had so suddenly removed from Blois,
but François soon told her, something after
this wise: "Our mother," said he, "is deeply
concerned with affairs of state. There is some
conspiracy against her and your uncles, the
Guises."</p>

<p>"Tell me," she demanded, "concerning this
dreadful conspiracy."</p>

<p>"Were you not suspicious," he asked, querulously,
"when we left for Amboise so suddenly?"</p>

<p>"<i>Ah, non, mon François</i>, methought that we
came here to hold a jousting tourney and to
hunt in the forest...."</p>

<p>"Well, at any rate, we are secure here from
Turk, or Jew, or Huguenot, my queen," replied
the king.</p>

<p>Within a short space a council was called in
the great hall of Amboise, which the Huguenot
chiefs, Condé, Coligny, the Cardinal de Chatillon,&mdash;who
appears to have been a sort of a
religious renegade,&mdash;were requested to attend.
A conciliatory edict was to be prepared, and
signed by the king, as a measure for gaining<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">161</a></span>
time and learning further the plans of the conspirators.</p>

<p>This edict ultimately was signed, but it was
in force but a short time and was a subterfuge
which the youthful king deep in his heart&mdash;and
he publicly avowed the fact&mdash;deeply resented.
Furthermore it did practically nothing
toward quelling the conspiracy.</p>

<p>Through the plains of Touraine and over
the hills from Anjou the conspirators came in
straggling bands, to rendezvous for a great
<i>coup de main</i> at Amboise. They halted at
farms and hid in vineyards, but the royalists
were on the watch and one after another the
wandering bands were captured and held for
a bloody public massacre when the time should
become ripe. In all, two thousand or more
were captured, including Jean Barri de la
Renaudie. This man was the leader, but he
was merely a bold adventurer, seeking his own
advantage, and caring little what cause employed
his peculiar talents. This was his last
affair, however, for his corpse soon hung in
chains from Amboise's bridge. Condé, Coligny,
and the other Calvinists soon learned that
the edict was not worth the paper on which it
was written.</p>

<p>After the two thousand had been dispersed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">162</a></span>
or captured the "queen-mother" threw off
the mask. She led the trembling child-king
and queen toward the southern terrace, where,
close beneath the windows of the château, was
built a scaffold, covered with black cloth, before
which stood the executioner clothed in
scarlet. The prisoners were ranged by hundreds
along the outer rampart, guarded by
archers and musketeers. The windows of the
royal apartment were open and here the company
placed themselves to witness the butchery
to follow.</p>

<p>Speechless with horror sat the young king
and queen, until finally, as another batch of
mutilated corpses were thrown into the river
below, the young queen swooned.</p>

<p>"My mother," said François, "I, too, am
overcome by this horrible sight. I crave your
Highness's permission to retire; the blood of
my subjects, even of my enemies, is too horrible
to contemplate."</p>

<p>"My son," said the bloodthirsty Catherine,
"I command you to stay. Duc de Guise, support
your niece, the Queen of France. Teach
her her duty as a sovereign. She must learn
how to govern those hardy Scots of hers."</p>

<p>It was on the very terraced platform on
which one walks to-day that, between two ranks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">163</a></span>
of <i>hallebardiers</i> and arquebusiers, moved that
long line of bareheaded and bowed men whose
prayers went up to heaven while they awaited
the fate of the gallows.</p>

<p>Either the cord or the sword-blade quickly
accounted for the lives of this multitude, and
their blood flowed in rivulets, while above in
the gallery the willing and unwilling onlookers
were gay with laughter or dumb with sadness.</p>

<p>When all this horrible murdering was over
the Loire was literally a reeking mass of
corpses, if we are to believe the records of the
time. The chief conspirators were hung in
chains from the castle walls, or from the
bridge, and the balustrades which overhang
the street, which to-day flanks the Loire beneath
the castle walls, were filled with a ribald
crew of jeering partisans who knew little and
cared less for religion of any sort.</p>

<p>Some days after the execution of the Calvinists
the "Protestant poet" and historian
passed through the royal city with his <i>précepteur</i>
and his father, and was shown the rows
of heads planted upon pikes, which decorated
the castle walls, and thereupon vowed, if not
to avenge, at least to perpetuate the infamy
in prose and verse, and this he did most effectually.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">164</a></span></p>

<p>An odorous garden of roses, lilacs, honeysuckle,
and hawthorn framed the joyous architecture
of the château, then as now, in adorable
fashion; but it could not purify the malodorous
reputation which it had received until
the domain was ceded by Louis XIV. to the
Duc de Penthièvre and made a <i>duché-pairie</i>.</p>

<p>It would be possible to say much more, but
this should suffice to stamp indelibly the fact
that Touraine, in general, and the château of
Amboise, in particular, cradled as much of the
thought and action of the monarchy in the fifteenth
and sixteenth centuries as did the capital
itself. At any rate the memory of it all is
so vivid, and the tangible monuments of the
splendour and intrigue of the court of those
days are so very numerous and magnificent,
that one could not forget the parts they played&mdash;once
having seen them&mdash;if he would.</p>

<p>After the assassination of the Duc de Guise
at Blois, Amboise became a prison of state,
where were confined the Cardinal de Bourbon
and César de Vendôme (the sons of Henri IV.
and Gabrielle d'Estrées), also Fouquet and
Lauzun. In 1762 the château was given by
Louis XV. to the Duc de Choiseul, and the great
Napoleon turned it over to his ancient colleague,
Roger Ducos, who apparently cared<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">165</a></span>
little for its beauties or associations, for he
mutilated it outrageously.</p>

<div class="caption"><a href="images/illus215.jpg"><i>Sculpture from the Chapelle de St. Hubert</i></a></div>
</div>


<p>In later times the history of the château
and its dependencies has been more prosaic.
The Emir Abd-el-Kader was imprisoned here
in 1852, and Louis Napoleon stayed for a time
within its walls upon his return from the
south. To-day it belongs to the family of Orleans,
to whom it was given by the National
Assembly in 1872, and has become a house of
retreat for military veterans. This is due to
the generosity of the Duc d'Aumale into whose
hands it has since passed. The restoration
which has been carried on has made of Amboise
an ideal reproduction of what it once was,
and in every way it is one of the most splendid
and famous châteaux of its kind, though by no
means as lovable as the residential châteaux
of Chenonceaux or Langeais.</p>

<p>The Chapelle de St. Hubert, which was restored
by Louis Philippe, is the chief artistic
attraction of Amboise; a bijou of full-blown
Gothic. It is a veritable architectural joy of
the period of Charles VIII., to whom its erection
was due. Its portal has an adorable bas-relief,
representing "La Chasse de St. Hubert,"
and showing St. Hubert, St. Christopher,
and St. Anthony, while above, in the tym<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">166</a></span>panum,
are effigies of the Virgin, of Charles
VIII., and of Anne de Bretagne. The sculpture
is, however, comparatively modern, but it
embellishes a shrine worthy in every way, for
there repose the bones of Leonardo da Vinci.
Formerly Da Vinci's remains had rested in the
chapel of the château itself, dedicated to St.
Florentin.</p>

<p>Often the Chapelle de St. Hubert has been
confounded with that described by Scott in
"Quentin Durward," but it is manifestly not
the same, as that was located in Tours or near
there, and his very words describe the architecture
as "of the rudest and meanest kind,"
which this is not. Over the arched doorway
of the chapel at Tours there was, however, a
"statue of St. Hubert with a bugle-horn
around his neck and a leash of greyhounds at
his feet," which may have been an early suggestion
of the later work which was undertaken
at Amboise.</p>

<p>All vocations came to have their protecting
saints in the middle ages, and, since "<i>la
chasse</i>" was the great recreation of so many,
distinction was bestowed upon Hubert as being
one of the most devout. The legend is sufficiently
familiar not to need recounting here,
and, anyway, the story is plainly told in this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">167</a></span>
sculptured panel over the portal of the chapel
at Amboise.</p>

<p>In this Chapel of St. Hubert was formerly
held "that which was called a hunting-mass.
The office was only used before the noble and
powerful, who, while assisting at the solemnity,
were usually impatient to commence their
favourite sport."</p>

<p>The ancient Salle des Gardes of the château,
with the windows giving on the balcony overlooking
the river, became later the Logis du
Roi. From this great chamber one passes on to
the terrace near the foot of the Grosse Tour,
called the Tour des Minimes. It is this tower
which contains the "<i>escalier des voitures</i>."
The entrance is through an elegant portico
leading to the upper stories. Above another
portico, leading from the terrace to the garden,
is to be seen the emblem of Louis XII., the porcupine,
so common at Blois.</p>

<p>In the fosse, which still remains on the garden
side, was the universally installed <i>jeu-de-paume</i>,
a favourite amusement throughout the
courts of Europe in the middle ages.</p>

<p>At the base of the château are clustered numerous
old houses of the sixteenth century,
but on the river-front these have been replaced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">168</a></span>
with pretentious houses, cafés, automobile garages,
and other modern buildings.</p>

<p>Near the Quai des Violettes are a series of
subterranean chambers known as the Greniers
de César, dating from the sixteenth century.</p>

</div>

<p>Even at this late day one can almost picture
the great characters in the drama of other
times who stalked majestically through the
apartments, and over the very flagstones of the
courts and terraces which one treads to-day;
Catherine de Medici with her ruffs and velvets;
Henri de Guise with all his wiles; Condé the
proud; the second François, youthful but wise;
his girl queen, loving and sad; and myriads
more of all ranks and of all shades of morality,&mdash;all
resplendent in the velvets and gold of
the costume of their time.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">169</a></span></p>

<p>Near the château is the Clos Luce, a Gothic
habitation in whose oratory died Leonardo da
Vinci, on May 2, 1519.</p>

<p>Immediately back of the château is the Forêt
d'Amboise, the scene of many gay hunting
parties when the court was here or at Chenonceaux,
which one reaches by traversing the
forest route. On the edge of this forest is
Chanteloup, remembered by most folk on account
of its atrocious Chinese-like pagoda,
built of the débris of the Château de la Bourdaisière,
by the Duc de Choiseul, in memory
of the attentions he received from the nobles
and bourgeois of the ville upon the fall of his
ministry and his disgrace at the hands of
Louis XV. and La Du Barry. It is a curious
form to be chosen when one had such beautiful
examples of architectural art near by, only
equalled, perhaps, in atrociousness by the
"Royal Pavilion" of England's George IV.</p>

<p>La Bourdaisière, near Amboise, of which
only the site remains, if not one of the chief
tourist attractions of the château country, has
at least a sentimental interest of abounding
importance for all who recall the details of the
life of "La Belle Gabrielle."</p>

<p>Here in Touraine Gabrielle d'Estrées was
born in 1565. She was twenty-six years old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">170</a></span>
when Henri IV. first saw her in the château
of her father at C&#339;uvres. So charmed was he
with her graces that he made her his <i>maîtresse</i>
forthwith, though the old court-life chronicles
of the day state that she already possessed
something more than the admiration of Sebastian
Zamet, the celebrated financier.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">171</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER VIII.<span class="pagenum"><a href="#Contents">To ToC</a></span></h2>

<h4>CHENONCEAUX</h4>

<div class="epi">"The castle of Chenonceaux is a fine place on the river
Cher, in a fine and pleasant country." <br />

<span class="smcapright">François Premier</span>.
</div>

<div class="epi">"The castle of Chenonceaux is one of the best and most
beautiful of our kingdom."<br />


<span class="smcap">Henri II.</span>
</div>


<p>The average visitor will come prepared to
worship and admire a château so praised by
two luxury-loving Kings of France.</p>

<p>Chenonceaux is noted chiefly for its château,
but the little village itself is charming. The
houses of the village are not very new, nor
very old, but the one long street is most attractive
throughout its length, and the whole
atmosphere of the place, from September to
December, is odorous with the perfume of red-purple
grapes. The vintage is not the equal
of that of the Bordeaux region, perhaps, nor
of Chinon, nor Saumur; but the <i>vin du pays</i>
of the Cher and the Loire, around Tours, is not
to be despised.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">172</a></span></p>

<p>Most tourists come to Chenonceaux by train
from Tours; others drive over from Amboise,
and yet others come by bicycle or automobile.
They are not as yet so numerous as might be
expected, and accordingly here, as elsewhere
in Touraine, every facility is given for visiting
the château and its park.</p>

<p>If you do not hurry off at once to worship
at the abode of the fascinating Diane, one of
the brightest ornaments of the court of François
Premier and his son Henri, you will enjoy
your dinner at the Hôtel du Bon Laboureur,
though most likely it will be a solitary one, and
you will be put to bed in a great chamber overlooking
the park, through which peep, in the
moonlight, the turrets of the château, and you
may hear the purling of the waters of the Cher
as it flows below the walls.</p>

<p>Jean Jacques Rousseau, like François I.,
called Chenonceaux a beautiful place, and he
was right; it is all of that and more. Here
one comes into direct contact with an atmosphere
which, if not feudal, or even mediæval,
is at least that of several hundred years
ago.</p>

<p>Chenonceaux is moored like a ship in the
middle of the rapidly running Cher, a dozen
miles or more above where that stream enters<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">173</a></span>
the Loire. As a matter of fact, the château
practically bridges the river, which flows under
its foundations and beneath its drawbridge on
either side, besides filling the moat with water.
The general effect is as if the building were
set in the midst of the stream and formed a
sort of island château. Round about is a gentle
meadow and a great park, which give to
this turreted architectural gem of Touraine
a setting which is equalled by no other château.</p>

<p>What the château was in former days we
can readily imagine, for nothing is changed
as to the general disposition. Boats came to
the water-gate, as they still might do if such
boats still existed, in true, pictorial legendary
fashion. To-day, the present occupant has
placed a curiosity on the ornamental waters
in the shape of a gondola. It is out of keeping
with the grand fabric of the château, and it
is a pity that it does not cast itself adrift some
night. What has become of the gondolier, who
was imported to keep the craft company, nobody
seems to know. He is certainly not in
evidence, or, if he is, has transformed himself
into a groom or a <i>chauffeur</i>.</p>

<p>The Château of Chenonceaux is not a very
ample structure; not so ample as most photo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">174</a></span>graphs
would make it appear. It is not tiny,
but still it has not the magnificent proportions
of Blois, of Chambord, or even of Langeais.
It was more a habitation than it was a fortress,
a <i>maison de campagne</i>, as indeed it virtually
became when the Connétable de Montmorency
took possession of the structure in
the name of the king, when its builder, Thomas
Bohier, the none too astute minister of finances
in Normandy, came to grief in his affairs.</p>

<p>François I. came frequently here for "<i>la
chasse</i>," and his memory is still kept alive by
the Chambre François Premier. François held
possession till his death, when his son made
it over to the "admired of two generations,"
Diane de Poitiers.</p>

<p>Diane's memory will never leave Chenonceaux.
To-day it is perpetuated in the Chambre
de Diane de Poitiers; but the portrait by
Leonardo da Vinci, which was supposed to best
show her charms, has now disappeared from
the "long gallery" at the château. This portrait
was painted at the command of François,
before Diane transferred her affections to his
son.</p>

<p>No one knows when or how Diane de Poitiers
first came to fascinate François, or how or
why her power waned. At any rate, at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">175</a></span>
time François pardoned her father, the witless
Comte de St. Vallier, for the treacherous part
he played in the Bourbon conspiracy, he really
believed her to be the "brightest ornament of
a beauty-loving court."</p>

<p>Certainly, Diane was a powerful factor in the
politics of her time, though François himself
soon tired of her. Undaunted by this, she
forthwith set her cap for his son Henri, the
Duc d'Orleans, and won him, too. Of her
beauty the present generation is able to
judge for itself by reason of the three well-known
and excellent portraits of contemporary
times.</p>

<p>Diane's influence over the young Henri was
absolute. At his death her power was, of
course, at an end, and Chenonceaux, and all else
possible, was taken from her by the orders of
Catherine, the long-suffering wife, who had
been put aside for the fascinations of the
charming huntress.</p>

<p>It must have been some satisfaction, however,
to Diane, to know that, in his fatal joust
with Montgomery, Henri really broke his lance
and met his death in her honour, for the records
tell that he bore her colours on his lance, besides
her initials set in gold and gems on his
shield.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">176</a></span></p>

<p>Catherine's eagerness to drive Diane from
the court was so great, that no sooner had her
spouse fallen&mdash;even though he did not actually
die for some days&mdash;than she sent word to
Diane, "who sat weeping alone," to instantly
quit the court; to give up the crown jewels&mdash;which
Henri had somewhat inconsiderately
given her; and to "give up Chenonceaux in
Touraine," Catherine's Naboth's vineyard,
which she had so long admired and coveted.
She had known it as a girl, when she often
visited it in company with her father-in-law,
the appreciative but dissolute François, and
had ever longed to possess it for her own,
before even her husband, now dead, had given
it to "that old hag Diane de Poitiers, Duchesse
de Valentinois."</p>

<p>Diane paid no heed to Catherine's command.
She simply asked: "Is the king yet
dead?"</p>

<p>"No, madame," said the messenger, "but
his wound is mortal; he cannot live the day."</p>

<p>"Tell the queen, then," replied Diane, "that
her reign is not yet come; that I am mistress
still over her and the kingdom as long as the
king breathes the breath of life."</p>

<p>Henri was more or less an equivocal character,
devoted to Diane, and likewise fond<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">177</a></span>one
says it with caution&mdash;of his wife. He
caused to be fashioned a monogram (seen at
Chenonceaux) after this wise:</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/illus229_small.jpg" alt="Monogram" title="Monogram" />
</div>

<p>supposedly indicating his attachment for Diane
and his wife alike. The various initials of the
cipher are in no way involved. Diane returned
the compliment by decorating an apartment for
the king, at her Château of Anet, with the black
and white of the Medici arms.</p>

<p>The Château of Chenonceaux, so greatly coveted
by Catherine when she first came to
France, and when it was in the possession of
Diane, still remains in all the regal splendour
of its past. It lies in the lovely valley of the
Cher, far from the rush and turmoil of cities
and even the continuous traffic of great thoroughfares,
for it is on the road to nowhere
unless one is journeying cross-country from
the lower to the upper Loire. This very isolation
resulted in its being one of the few monuments
spared from the furies of the Revolution,
and, "half-palace and half-château," it glistens<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">178</a></span>
with the purity of its former glory, as picturesque
as ever, with turrets, spires, and roof-tops
all mellowed with the ages in a most entrancing
manner.</p>

<p>Even to-day one enters the precincts of the
château proper over a drawbridge which spans
an arm of the Loire, or rather, a moat which
leads directly from the parent stream. On the
opposite side are the bridge piers supporting
five arches, the work of Diane when she was
the fair chatelaine of the domain. This ingenious
thought proved to be a most useful and
artistic addition to the château. It formed a
flagged promenade, lovely in itself, and led to
the southern bank of the Cher, whence one
got charming vistas of the turrets and roof-tops
of the château through the trees and the
leafy avenues which converged upon the structure.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<a href="images/illus231.jpg">
<img src="images/illus231_small.jpg" alt="Château de Chenonceaux" title="Château de Chenonceaux" />
</a>
</div>



<p>When Catherine came she did not disdain
to make the best use of Diane's innovation that
suggested itself to her, which was simply to
build the "Long Gallery" over the arches of
this lovely bridge, and so make of it a veritable
house over the water. A covering was made
quite as beautiful as the rest of the structure,
and thus the bridge formed a spacious wing
of two stories. The first floor&mdash;known as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">179</a></span>
"Long Gallery"&mdash;was intended as a banqueting-hall,
and possessed four great full-length
windows on either side looking up and down
stream, from which was seen&mdash;and is to-day&mdash;an
outlook as magnificently idyllic as is possible
to conceive. Jean Goujon had designed
for the ceiling one of those wonder-works for
which he was famous, but if the complete plan
was ever carried out, it has disappeared, for
only a tiny sketch of the whole scheme remains
to-day.</p>

<div class="figright">
<img src="images/illus233_small.jpg" alt="Château of Checonceaux (Diagram)" title="Château of Checonceaux (Diagram)" />
</div>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">180</a></span>Catherine came in the early summer to take
possession of her long-coveted domain. Being
a skilful horsewoman, she came on horseback,
accompanied by a "<i>petite bande</i>" of feminine
charmers destined to wheedle political secrets
from friends and enemies alike,&mdash;a real "<i>escadron
volant de la reine</i>," as it was called by
a contemporary.</p>

<p>It was a gallant company that assembled here
at this time,&mdash;the young King Charles IX.,
the Duc de Guise, and "two cardinals mounted
on mules,"&mdash;Lorraine, a true Guise, and
D'Este, newly arrived from Italy, and accompanied
by the poet Tasso, wearing a "gabardine
and a hood of satin." Catherine showed
the Italian great favour, as was due a countryman,
but there was another poet among them
as well, Ronsard, the poet laureate of the time.
The Duc de Guise had followed in the wake
of Marguerite, unbeknownst to Catherine, who
frowned down any possibility of an alliance
between the houses of Valois and Lorraine.</p>

<p>A great fête and water-masque had been
arranged by Catherine to take place on the
Cher, with a banquet to follow in the Long
Gallery in honour of her arrival at Chenonceaux.</p>

<p>When twilight had fallen, torches were ig<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">181</a></span>nited
and myriads of lights blazed forth from
the boats on the river and from the windows
of the château. Music and song went forth
into the night, and all was as gay and lovely
as a Venetian night's entertainment. The
hunting-horns echoed through the wooded
banks, and through the arches above which
the château was built passed great highly
coloured barges, including a fleet of gondolas
to remind the queen-mother of her Italian days,&mdash;the
ancestors perhaps of the solitary gondola
which to-day floats idly by the river-bank
just before the grand entrance to the château.
From <i>parterre</i> and <i>balustrade</i>, and from the
clipped yews of the ornamental garden, fairy
lamps burned forth and dwindled away into
dim infinity, as the long lines of soft light gradually
lost themselves in the forest. It was a
grand affair and idyllic in its unworldliness.
One may not see its like to-day, for electric
lights and "rag-time" music, which mostly
comprise the attractions of such <i>al fresco</i> pleasures,
will hardly produce the same effect.</p>

<p>Among the great fêtes at Chenonceaux will
always be recalled that given by the court upon
the coming of the youthful François II. and
Mary Stuart, after the horrible massacres at
Amboise.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">182</a></span></p>

<p>All the Renaissance skill of the time was
employed in the erection of pompous accessories,
triumphal arches, columns, obelisks, and
altars. There were innumerable tablets also,
bearing inscriptions in Latin and Greek,&mdash;which
nobody read,&mdash;and a fountain which
bore the following:</p>


<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i3">"Au saint bal des dryades,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">A Ph&#339;bus, ce grand dieu,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Aux humides nyades,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">J'ai consacré ce lieu."<br /></span>
</div></div>


<p>Of Chenonceaux and its glories what more
can be said than to quote the following lines
of the middle ages, which in their quaint old
French apply to-day as much as ever they did:</p>


<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i3">"Basti si magnifiquement<br /></span>
<span class="i4">II est debout, comme un géant,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Dedans le lit de la rivière,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">C'est-à-dire dessus un pont<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Qui porte cent toises de long."<br /></span>
</div></div>


<p>The part of the edifice which Bohier erected
in 1515 is that through which the visitor makes
his entrance, and is built upon the piers of an
old mill which was destroyed at that time.</p>

<p>Catherine bequeathed Chenonceaux to the
wife of Henri III., Louise de Vaudémont, who
died here in 1601. For a hundred years it still
belonged to royalty, but in 1730 it was sold to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">183</a></span>
M. Dupin, who, with his wife, enriched and
repaired the fabric. They gathered around
them a company so famous as to be memorable
in the annals of art and literature. This is
best shown by the citing of such names as Fontenelle,
Montesquieu, Buffon, Bolingbroke, Voltaire,
and Rousseau, all of whom were frequenters
of the establishment, the latter being
charged with the education of the only son of
M. and Madame Dupin.</p>

<p>Considering Rousseau's once proud position
among his contemporaries, and the favour with
which he was received by the nobility, it is
somewhat surprising that his struggle for life
was so hard. The Marquise de Créquy wrote
in her "Souvenirs:" "Rousseau left behind
him his <i>Mémoires</i>, which I think for the sake of
his memory and fame ought to be much curtailed."
And undoubtedly she was right. Rousseau
wrote in his "Confessions:" "In 1747
we went to spend the autumn in Touraine, at
the Château of Chenonceaux, a royal residence
upon the Cher, built by Henri II. for Diane de
Poitiers, whose initials are still to be seen
there.... We amused ourselves greatly in
this fine spot; the living was of the best, and
I became fat as a monk. We made a great deal
of music and acted comedies."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">184</a></span></p>

<p>One might imagine, from a stroll through the
magnificent halls and galleries of Chenonceaux,
that Rousseau's experiences might be repeated
to-day if one were fortunate enough to be asked
to sojourn there for a time. The nearest that
one can get, however, to becoming personally
identified with the château and its life is to sign
his name in the great vellum quarto which ultimately
will rest in the archives of the château.</p>

<p>It is doubtless very wrong to be covetous;
but Chenonceaux is such a beautiful place and
comes so near the ideal habitation of our imagination
that the desire to possess it for one's
own is but human.</p>

<p>In the "Galerie Louis XIV." were given the
first representations of many of Rousseau's
pieces.</p>

<p>One gathers from these accounts of the happenings
in the Long Gallery that it formed no
bridge of sighs, and most certainly it did not.
Its walls resounded almost continually with
music and laughter. Here in these rooms
Henri II. danced and made love and intrigued,
while Catherine, his queen, was left at Blois
with her astrologer and his poisons, to eat out
her soul in comparative neglect.</p>

<p>Before the time of the dwelling built by
Bohier for himself and family on the founda<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">185</a></span>tions
of the old mill, there was yet a manorhouse
belonging to the ancient family of
Marques, from whom the Norman financier
bought the site. The tower, seen to-day at the
right of the entrance to the château proper,&mdash;an
expressive relic of feudal times,&mdash;was a
part of the earlier establishment. To-day it
is turned into a sort of <i>kiosque</i> for the sale
of photographs, post-cards, and an admirable
illustrated guide to the château.</p>

<p>The interior of the château to-day presents
the following remarkable features: The dining-room
of to-day, formerly the Salle des Gardes,
has a ceiling in which the cipher of Catherine
de Medici is interwoven with an arabesque. To
the left of this apartment is the entrance to
the chapel, which to-day seems a bit incongruously
placed, leading as it does from the dining-room.
It is but a tiny chapel, but it is as gay
and brilliant as if it were still the adjunct of a
luxury-loving court, and it has some glass dating
from 1521, which, if not remarkable for
design or colouring, is quite choice enough to
rank as an art treasure of real value.</p>

<p>According to Viollet-le-Duc each feudal seigneur
had attached to his château a chapel,
often served by a private chaplain, and in some
instances by an entire chapter of prelates.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">186</a></span>
These chapels were not simple oratories surrounded
by the domestic apartments, but were
architectural monuments in themselves, and
either entirely isolated, as at Amboise, or semi-detached,
as at Chenonceaux.</p>

<p>Below, in the sub-basement, at Chenonceaux,
are the original foundations upon which Bohier
laid his first stones. Here, too, are various
chambers, known respectively as the prison,
the Bains de la Reine, the <i>boulangerie</i>, etc.</p>

<p>Chenonceaux to-day is no whited sepulchre.
It is a real living and livable thing, and, moreover,
when one visits it, he observes that the
family burn great logs in their fireplaces, have
luxurious bouquets of flowers on their dining-table,
and use great wax candles instead of the
more prosaic oil-lamps, or worse&mdash;acetylene
gas. Chenonceaux evidently has no thoughts
of descending to steam heat and electricity.</p>

<p>All this is as it should be, for when one visits
a shrine like this he prefers to find it with as
much as possible of the old-time atmosphere
remaining. Chambord is bare and suggestive
of the tomb, in spite of the splendour of its
outline and proportions; Pierrefonds, in the
north, is more so, and so would be Blois except
for its restored or imitation decorations; but
here at Chenonceaux all is different, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">187</a></span>
breathes the spirit of other days as well as
that of to-day. It is, perhaps, not exactly as
Diane left it, or as Rousseau knew it under
the régime of the Dupins, since, after many
changings of hands, it became the property of
the <i>Crédit Foncier</i>, by whom it was sold in 1891
to Mr. Terry, an American.</p>

<p>Chenonceaux has two other architectural
monuments which are often overlooked under
the spell of the more magnificent château. In
the village is a small Renaissance church&mdash;in
which the Renaissance never rose to any very
great heights&mdash;which is here far more effective
and beautiful than usually are Renaissance
churches of any magnitude. There is also a
sixteenth-century stone house in the same style
and even more successful as an expression of
the art of the time. It is readily found by
inquiry, and is known as the "Maison des
Pages de François I."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">188</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER IX.<span class="pagenum"><a href="#Contents">To ToC</a></span></h2>

<h4>LOCHES</h4>


<p>Much may be written of Loches, of its storied
past, of its present-day quaintness, and of its
wealth of architectural monuments. Its church
is certainly the most curious religious edifice
in all France, judging from a cross-section of
the vaults and walls. More than all else, however,
Loches is associated in our minds with
the memory of Agnes Sorel.</p>

<p>Within the walls of the old collegiate church
the lovely mistress of Charles VII. was buried
in 1450; but later her remains and tomb were
removed to one of the towers of the ancient
castle of Loches, where they now are. She had
amply endowed the church, but they would no
longer give shelter to her remains, so her bones
were removed five hundred years later. The
statue which surmounts her tomb, as seen to-day,
represents the "gentille Agnes" in all
her loveliness, with folded hands on breast, a
kneeling angel at her head and a couchant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">189</a></span>
lamb at her feet,&mdash;a reminder of her innocence,
said Henry James, but surely he nodded
when he said it. Lovely she was, and good in
her way, but innocent she was not, as we have
come to know the word.</p>

<div class="figright">
<img src="images/illus243_small.jpg" alt="Loches" title="Loches" />
<div class="caption"><a href="images/illus243.jpg"><i>Loches</i></a></div>
</div>




<p>It is fitting to recall that Charles VII. was
not the only monarch who sang her praises, for
it was François I. who, many years later, wrote
those lines beginning:</p>


<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Gentille Agnes, plus de loz tu mérites."<br /></span>
</div></div>


<p>Whether one comes to Loches by road or by
rail, the first impression is the same; he enters
at once into a sleepy, old-world town which
has practically nothing of modernity about it
except the electric lights.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">190</a></span></p>

<p>There is but one way to realize the immense
wealth of architectural monuments centred at
Loches, and that is to see the city for the first
time, as, perhaps, François Premier saw it
when he journeyed from Amboise, and came
upon it from the heights of the forest of
Loches. The city has not grown much since
that day. Then it had three thousand eight
hundred souls, and now it has five thousand.</p>

<p>Here, in the Forêt de Loches, Henry II. of
England built a monastery,&mdash;yet to be seen,&mdash;known
as the Chartreuse du Liget, in repentance,
or, perhaps, as a penance for the murder
of Becket. Over the doorway of this monastery
was graven:</p>

<div class="smcapcent">
ANGLORUM HENRICUS REX<br />
THOMÆ C&#338;DE CRUENTUS,<br />
LIGETICOS FUNDAT CARTUSIA MONAKOS.
</div>

<p>To-day the monastery is the property of a
M. de Marsay, and therefore not open to the
public; but the Chapelle du Liget, near by, is a
fine contemporary church of the thirteenth century,
well worth the admiration too infrequently
bestowed upon it.</p>

<p>The first view of Loches must really be much
as it was in François's time, except, perhaps,
that the roadway down from the forest has
improved, as roads have all over France, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">191</a></span>
fruit-trees and vineyards planted out, which,
however, in no way change the aspect when the
town is first seen in the dim haze of an early
November morning.</p>

<p>It is the sky-line <i>ensemble</i> of the châteaux of
the Renaissance period which is their most
varied feature. No two are alike, and yet they
are all wonderfully similar in that they cut the
sky with turret, tower, and chimney in a way
which suggests nothing as much as the architecture
of fairy-land.</p>

<p>The artists who illustrated the old fairy-tale
books and drew castles wherein dwelt beautiful
maidens could nowhere have found more real
inspiration than among the châteaux of the
Loire, the Cher, and the Indre.</p>

<p>Loches is a veritable mediæval town, and it
is even more than that, for its history dates
back into the earliest years of feudal times.
Loches is one of those <i>soi-disant</i> French towns
not great enough to be a metropolis, and yet
quite indifferent to the affairs of the outside
world.</p>

<p>The only false notes are those sounded by the
various hawkers and cadgers for the visitor's
money, who have hired various old mediæval
structures, within the walls, and assure one
that in the basement of their establishment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">192</a></span>
there are fragments "recently discovered,"&mdash;this
in English,&mdash;quite worth the price of admission
which they charge you to peer about
in a gloomy hole of a cellar, littered with empty
wine-bottles and rubbish of all sorts.</p>

<p>All this is delightful enough to the simon-pure
antiquarian; but even he likes to dig
things out for himself, and the householders
can't all expect to find <i>cachots</i> in their sub-cellars
or iron cages in their garrets unless they
manufacture them.</p>

<p>The old town, in spite of its lack of modernity,
is full of surprises and contrasts that must
make it very livable to one who cares to spend
a winter within its walls. He may walk about
on the ramparts on sunny days; may fish in the
Indre, below the mill; and, if he is an artist, he
will find, within a comparatively small area,
much more that is exceedingly "paintable"
than is usually found in the fishing-villages of
Brittany or on the sand-dunes of the Pas de
Calais, "artist's sketching-grounds" which
have been pretty well worked of late.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/illus247_small.jpg" alt="Loches and Its Church" title="Loches and Its Church" />
<div class="caption"><a href="images/illus247.jpg"><i>Loches and Its Church</i></a></div>
</div>




<p>The history of Loches is so varied and vivid
that it is easy to account for the many remains
of feudal and Renaissance days now existing.
The derivation of its name is in some doubt.
Loches was unquestionably the Luccæ of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">193</a></span>
Romans, but the Armorican Celts had the word
<i>loc'h</i>, meaning much the same thing,&mdash;<i>un
marais</i>,&mdash;which is also wonderfully like the
<i>loch</i> known to-day in the place-names of Scotland
and the <i>lough</i> of Ireland. Partisans may
take their choice.</p>

<p>In the fifth century a monastery was founded
here by St. Ours, which ultimately gave its
name to the collegiate church which exists to-day.
A château, or more probably a fortress,
appeared in the sixth century. The city was
occupied by the Franks in the seventh century,
but by 630 it had become united with Aquitaine.
Pepin sacked it in 742, and Charles le Chauve
made it a seat of a hereditary government
which, by alliance, passed to the house of Anjou
in 886, to whom it belonged up to 1205.
Jean-sans-Terre gave it to France in 1193.
Richard C&#339;ur de Lion apparently resented
this, for he retook it in the year following. In
1204, Philippe-Auguste besieged Chinon and
Loches simultaneously, and took the latter
after a year, when he made it a fief, and gave it
to Dreux de Mello, Constable of France, who
in turn sold it to St. Louis.</p>

<p>The château of Loches became first a fortress,
guarding the ancient Roman highway
from the Blaisois to Aquitaine, then a prison,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">194</a></span>
and then a royal residence, to which Charles
VII. frequently repaired with Agnes Sorel,
which calls up again the strangely contrasting
influences of the two women whose names have
gone down in history linked with that of
Charles VII.</p>

<p>"Louis XI. aggrandized the château," says
a French authority, "and perfected the prisons,"
whatever that may mean. He did, we
know, build those terrible dungeons far down
below the surface of the ground, where daylight
never penetrated. They were perfect enough
in all conscience as originally built, at least as
perfect as the celebrated iron cage in which he
imprisoned Cardinal Balue. The cage is not in
its wonted place to-day, and only a ring in the
wall indicates where it was once made fast.</p>

<p>Charles VIII. added the great round tower;
but it was not completed until the reign of
Louis XII. François I., in a not too friendly
meeting, received Charles Quint here in 1539,
just previous to his visit to Amboise. Marie de
Medici, on escaping from Blois, stopped at the
château at the invitation of the governor, the
Duc d'Epernon, who sped her on her way, as
joyfully as possible, to Angoulême.</p>

<p>The château itself is the chief attraction of
interest, just as it is the chief feature of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">195</a></span>
landscape when viewed from afar. Of course
it is understood that, when one speaks of the
château at Loches, he refers to the collective
châteaux which, in more or less fragmentary
form, go to make up the edifice as it is to-day.</p>

<p>Whether we admire most the structure of
Geoffrey Grise-Gonelle, the elegant edifice of
the fifteenth century, or the additions of
Charles VII., Louis XI., Charles VIII., Louis
XII., or Henri III., we must conclude that to
know this conglomerate structure intimately
one must actually live with it. Nowhere in
France&mdash;perhaps in no country&mdash;is there a
château that suggests so stupendously the story
of its past.</p>

<p>The chief and most remarkable features are
undoubtedly the great rectangular keep or donjon,
and the Tour Neuf or Tour Ronde. The
first, in its immensity, quite rivals the best
examples of the kind elsewhere, if it does not
actually excel them in dimensions. It is, moreover,
according to De Caumont, the most beautiful
of all the donjons of France. As a state
prison it confined Jean, Duc d'Alençon, Pierre
de Brézé, and Philippe de Savoie.</p>

<p>The Tour Ronde is a great cylinder flanked
with dependencies which give it a more or less
irregular form. It encloses the prison where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">196</a></span>
were formerly kept the famous cages, the invention
of Cardinal Balue, who himself became
their first victim. The Tour Ronde is reminiscent
of two great female figures in the mediæval
portrait gallery,&mdash;Agnes Sorel and Anne
de Bretagne. The tomb of Agnes Sorel is here,
and the Duchesse Anne made an oratory in this
grim tower, from which she sent up her prayer
for the success and unity of the political plans
which inspired her marriage into the royal
family of France. It is a daintily decorated
chamber, with the queen's family device, the
ermine with its twisted necklet, prominently
displayed.</p>

<p>In the passage which conducts to the dungeons
of this great round tower, one reads this
ironical invitation: "<i>Entrés, messieurs, ches le
Roy Nostre Mestre</i>" (<i>O.F.</i>).</p>

<p>That portion of the collective châteaux facing
to the north is now occupied by the Sous-Préfecture,
and is more after the manner of
the residential châteaux of the Loire than of
a fortress-stronghold or prison. Before this
portion stands the famous chestnut-tree,
planted, it is said, by François I., "and large
enough to shelter the whole population of
Loches beneath its foliage," says the same
doubtful authority.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">197</a></span></p>

<p>Under a fifteenth-century structure, called
the Martelet, are the true dungeons of Loches.
Here one is shown the cell occupied for nine
years by the poor Ludovic Sforza, who died
in 1510, from the mere joy of being liberated.
More deeply hidden still is the famous Prison
des Évêques of the era of François I. and the
dungeon of Comte de St. Vallier, the father of
the fascinating Diane, who herself was the
means of securing his liberation by "fascinating
the king," as one French writer puts it.
This may be so. St. Vallier <i>was</i> liberated, we
know, and the susceptible François <i>was</i> fascinated,
though he soon tired of Diane and her
charms. She had the perspicacity, however, to
transfer her affections to his son, and so kept
up a sort of family relationship.</p>

<p>Like the historic "prisoner of Gisors," the
occupants of the dungeons at Loches whiled
away their lonely hours by inscribing their
sentiments upon the walls. Only one remains
to-day, though fragmentary stone-carved letters
and characters are to be seen here and
there. He who wrote the following was certainly
as cheerful as circumstances would allow:</p>


<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0_5">"Malgré les ennuis d'une longue souffrance,<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">198</a></span>Et le cruel destin dont je subis la loy,<br /><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Il est encort des biens pour moy,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Le tendre amour et la douce espérance."<br /></span>
</div></div>


<p>Most of these formidable dungeons of Loches
were prisons of state until well into the sixteenth
century.</p>

<div class="figright">
<a href="images/illus254.jpg">
<img src="images/illus254_small.jpg" alt="Sketch Plan of Loches" title="Sketch Plan of Loches" />
</a>
</div>


<p>Beneath, or rather beside, the very walls of
the château is the bizarre collegiate church of
St. Ours. One says bizarre, simply because it
is curious, and not because it is unchurchly in
any sense of the word, for it is not. Its low
nave is surmounted by an enormous tower with
a stone spire, while there are two other pyramidal
erections over the roof of the choir which
make the whole look, not like an elephant, as
a cynical Frenchman once wrote, but rather<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">199</a></span>
like a camel with two humps. This strange
architectural anomaly is, in parts, almost
pagan; certainly its font, a fragment of an
ancient altar on which once burned a sacred
fire, <i>is</i> pagan.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/illus255_small.jpg" alt="St. Ours, Loches" title="St. Ours, Loches" />
<div class="caption"><a href="images/illus255.jpg"><i>St. Ours, Loches</i></a></div>
</div>

<p>There is a Romanesque porch of vast dimensions
which is the real artistic expression of the
fabric, dressed with extraordinary primitive
sculptures of saints, demons, stryges, gnomes,
and all manner of outré things. All these details,
however, are chiselled with a masterly
conception.</p>

<p>Behind this exterior vestibule the first bays
of the nave form another, a sort of an inner
vestibule, which carries out still further the
unique arrangement of the whole edifice. This
portion of the structure dates from a consecration
of the year 965, which therefore classes it
as of very early date,&mdash;indeed, few are earlier.
Most of the church, however, is of the twelfth
century, including another great pyramid which
rises above the nave and the two smaller ones
just behind the spire. The side-aisles of the
nave were added between the twelfth and fifteenth
centuries, while only the stalls and the
tabernacle are as recent as the sixteenth. The
eastern end is triapsed, an unusual feature in
France. From this one realizes, quite to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">200</a></span>
fullest extent possible, the antiquity and individuality
of the Église de St. Ours at Loches.</p>

<p>The quaint Renaissance Hôtel-de-Ville was
built by the architect Jean Beaudoin (1535-1543),
from sums raised, under letters patent
from François I., by certain <i>octroi</i> taxes.
From the fact that through its lower story
passes one of the old city entrances, it has come
to be known also as the Porte Picoys. In every
way it is a worthy example of Renaissance
civic architecture.</p>

<p>In the Rue de Château is a remarkable
Renaissance house, known as the Chancellerie,
which dates from the reign of Henri II. It has
most curious sculptures on its façade interspersed
with the devices of royalty and the inscription:</p>

<div class="smcapcent">IVSTITIA REGNO, PRUDENTIA NUTRISCO.</div>

<p>The Tour St. Antoine serves to-day as the
city's belfry. It is all that remains of a church,
demolished long since, which was built in 1519-30,
in imitation of St. Gatien's of Tours.
Doubtless it was base in many of its details, as
is its more famous compeer at Tours; but, if the
old tower which remains is any indication, it
must have been an elaborate and imposing work
of the late Gothic and early Renaissance era.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">201</a></span></p>

<p>As a literary note, lovers of Dumas's romances
will be interested in the fact that in the
Hôtel de la Couroirie at Loches a body of Protestants
captured the celebrated Chicot, the
jester of Henri III. and Henri IV.</p>

<p>Loches has a near neighbour in Beaulieu,
which formerly possessed an ardent hatred for
its more progressive and successful contemporary,
Loches. Its very name has been perverted
by local historians as coming from Bellilocus,
"the place of war," and not "<i>le lieu
d'un bel aspect</i>."</p>

<p>The abbey church at Beaulieu was built by
the warlike Foulques Nerra (in 1008-12), who
usually built fortresses and left church-building
to monks and bishops. It is a remarkable
Romanesque example, though, since the fifteenth
century, it has been mostly in ruins.
Foulques Nerra himself, whose countenance
had "<i>la majesté de celui d'un ange</i>," found his
last resting-place within its walls, which also
sheltered much rich ornament, to-day greatly
defaced, though that of the nave, which is still
intact, is an evidence of its former worth.</p>

<p>The abbatial residence, still existent, has a
curious exterior pulpit built into the wall, examples
of which are not too frequent in France.</p>

<p>Agnes Sorel, the belle of belles, lived here for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">202</a></span>
a time in a house near the Porte de Guigné,
which bears a great stone <i>panonceau</i>, from
which the armorial bearings have to-day disappeared.
It is another notable monument to
"the most graceful woman of her times," and
without doubt has as much historic value as
many another more popular shrine of history.</p>

<p>In connection with Agnes Sorel, who was so
closely identified with Loches and Beaulieu, it
is to be recalled that she was known to the
chroniclers of her time as "<i>la dame de Beauté-sur-Marne</i>,"&mdash;a
place which does not appear in
the books of the modern geographers. It may
be noted, too, that it was the encouragement of
the "<i>belle des belles</i>" of Charles VII. that, in
a way, contributed to that monarch's success
in politics and arms, for her sway only began
with Jeanne d'Arc's supplication at Gien and
Chinon. Tradition has it, indeed, that it was
the "gentille Agnes" who put the sword of
victory in his hands when he set out on his
campaign of reconquest. Thus does the Jeanne
d'Arc legend receive a damaging blow.</p>




<p>The château of Sausac, an elegant edifice of
the sixteenth century, completely restored in
later days, is near by.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">203</a></span></p>

<h4>TOURS AND ABOUT THERE</h4>

</div>

<p>Tours, above all other of the ancient capitals
of the French provinces, remains to-day a <i>ville
de luxe</i>, the elegant capital of a land balmy and
delicious; a land of which Dante sung:</p>



<div class="center">"Terra molle, e dolce e dilettosa...."</div>



<p>It is not a very grand town as the secondary
cities of France go; not like Rouen or Lyons,
Bordeaux or Marseilles; but it is as typical a
reflection of the surrounding country as any,
and therein lies its charm.</p>

<p>One never comes within the influence of its
luxurious, or, at least, easy and comfortable
appointments, its distinctly modern and up-to-date
railway station, its truly magnificent modern
Hôtel de Ville, its well-appointed hotels
and cafés and its luxurious shops, but that he
realizes all this to a far greater extent than in
any other city of France.</p>

<p>And again, referring to the material things<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">204</a></span>
of life, everything is most comfortable, and the
restaurants and hotels most attractive in their
fare. Tours is truly one provincial capital
where the <i>cuisine bourgeoise</i> still lives.</p>

<p>Touraine, and Tours in particular, besides
many other things, is noted for its hotels. Their
praises have been sung often and loudly, not
forgetting Henry James's praise of the Hôtel
de l'Univers, which is all one expects to find it
and more. The same may be said of the Hôtel
du Croissant, with the added opinion that it
serves the most bountiful and excellent <i>déjeuner</i>
to be had in all provincial France. It
is difficult to say just what actually causes all
this excellence and abundance, except that the
catering there is an easy and pleasurable occupation.</p>

<p>The Rue Nationale&mdash;"<i>toujours et vraiment
royale</i>"&mdash;is the great artery of Tours running
riverwards. On it circulates all the life of
the city.</p>

<p>To the right is the Quartier de la Cathédrale,
where are assembled the great houses of the
nobility&mdash;or such of them as are left&mdash;and of
the old <i>bourgeoisie tourangelle</i>.</p>

<p>To the left are the streets of the workers, a
silk-mill or two, and the printing-offices. Tours
is and always has been celebrated for the num<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">205</a></span>ber
and size of its <i>imprimeries</i>, with which, in
olden times, the name of the great Christopher
Plantin, the master printer of Antwerp, was
connected. To-day, Tours's greatest establishment
is that of Alfred Mame et Fils, known
throughout the Roman Catholic world.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/illus265_small.jpg" alt="Arms of the Printers, Avocats, and Innkeepers,

<div class="caption"><a href="images/illus265.jpg"><i>Arms of the Printers, Avocats, and Innkeepers, Tours</i></a></div>
</div>



<p>The printers and booksellers of the middle
ages were favoured persons, and their rank
was high. In the days of solemn processions
the booksellers led the way, followed by the
paper-makers, the parchment-makers, the
scribes,&mdash;who had not wholly died out,&mdash;the
binders and the illuminators. In these days
the printers were granted an emblazoned arms,
which was characteristic and distinguished.
The same was true of the <i>avocats</i>, who bore
upon their escutcheon a gowned figure, with
something very like a halo surrounding its
head. The innkeepers went one better, and had
a bishop with an undeniable halo. This is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">206</a></span>
curious and inexplicable in the light of our
modern conception of similar things, but it's
better than a shield with quarterings representing
half a canal-boat and half a locomotive,
which was recently adopted by an enterprising
watering-place which shall be nameless.</p>

<p>In the same ancient quarter are the old
towers of Charlemagne and St. Martin. This
part of the town is the nucleus of the old foundation,
the site of the <i>oppidum</i> of the <i>Turones</i>,
the <i>Cæsarodunum gallo-romain</i>, and of the life
which centred around the old abbey of St.
Martin, so venerated and so powerful in the
middle ages.</p>

<p>To the inviolable refuge of this old abbey
came multitudes of Christian pilgrims from
the world over; the Merovingians to undergo
the penances imposed upon them by the bishops
and clerics in expiation of their crimes.
Under Charlemagne, the Abbé Alcuin founded
great schools of languages, history, astronomy,
and music, from which founts of learning went
forth innumerable and illustrious religious
teachers.</p>

<p>All but the two towers of this old religious
foundation are gone. The years of the Revolution
saw the fall of the abbey; a street was cut
through the nave of its church, and the two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">207</a></span>
dismembered parts stand to-day as monuments
to the sacrilege of modern times.</p>

<p>To-day a banal faubourg has sprung up
around the site of the abbey, with here and
there old tumble-down houses either of wood
and stone, such as one reads of in the pages of
Balzac, or sees in the designs of Doré, or with
their sides covered with overlapping slates.</p>

<p>Amid all these is an occasional treasure of
architectural art, such as the graceful Fountain
of Beaune, the work of Michel Colombe, and
some remains of early Renaissance houses of
somewhat more splendid appointments than
their fellows, particularly the Maison de Tristan
l'Hermite, the Hôtel Xaincoings, and many
exquisite fragments now made over into an
<i>auberge</i> or a <i>cabaret</i>, which make one dream of
Rabelais and his Gargantua.</p>

<p>It is uncertain whether Michel Colombe, who
designed this fountain and also that masterwork,
the tomb of the Duc François II. and
Marguerite de Foix, at Nantes, was a Tourangeau
or a Breton, but Tours claims him for her
own, and settles once for all the spelling of his
name by producing a "<i>papier des affaires</i>"
signed plainly "Colombe." The proof lies in
this document, signed in a notary's office at
Tours, concerning payments which were made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">208</a></span>
to him on behalf of the magnificent sepulchre
which he executed for the church of St. Sauveur
at La Rochelle. In his time&mdash;fifteenth century&mdash;Colombe
had no rivals in the art of monumental
sculpture in France, and with reason
he has been called the Michel Ange of France.</p>

<p>The cathedral quarter has for its chief attraction
that gorgeously florid St. Gatien, whose
ornate façade was likened by a certain monarch
to a magnificently bejewelled casket. It is an
interesting and lovable Gothic-Renaissance
church which, if not quite of the first rank
among the masterpieces of its kind, is a marvel
of splendour, and an example of the "<i>caprices
d'une guipure d'art</i>," as the French call it.</p>

<p>Bordering the Loire at Tours is a series
of tree-lined quays and promenades which are
the scenes, throughout the spring and summer
months, of fêtes and fairs of many sorts. Here,
too, at the extremity of the Rue Nationale, are
statues of Descartes and Balzac.</p>

<p>The Tour de Guise on the river-bank recalls
the domination of the Plantagenet kings of
England, who were Counts of Anjou since it
formed a part of the twelfth-century château
built here by Henry II. of England.</p>

<div class="caption"><a href="images/illus269.jpg">
<i>Scene in the Quartier de la Cathédrale, Tours</i></a></div>
</div>



<p>At the opposite extremity of the city is another
other tower, the Tour de Foubert, which pro<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">209</a></span>tected
the feudal domain of the old abbey of
St. Martin. The history of days gone by at
Tours was more churchly than political.</p>

<p>Once only&mdash;during the reign of Louis XII.&mdash;did
the States General meet at Tours (in
1506). Then the deputies of the <i>bourgeoisie</i>
met alone for their deliberations, the chief outcome
of which was to bestow upon the king the
eminently fitting title of "Père du Peuple."
One may question the righteousness of Louis
XII. in throwing over his wife, Jeanne de
France, in order to serve political ends by acquiring
the estates of Anne of Brittany for the
Crown of France for ever, but there is no doubt
but that he did it for the "<i>good of his people</i>."</p>

<p>The principal literary shrine at Tours is the
house, in the Rue Nationale, where was born
Honoré de Balzac.</p>

<p>One could not do better than to visit Tours
during the "<i>été de St. Martin</i>," since it was the
soldier-priest of Tours who gave his name to
that warm, bright prolongation of summer
which in France (and in England) is known as
"St. Martin's summer," and which finds its
counterpart in America's "Indian summer."</p>

<p>The legend tells us that somewhere in the
dark ages lived a soldier named Martin. He
was always of a charitable disposition, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">210</a></span>
none asked alms of him in vain. One November
day, when the wind blew briskly and the snow
fell fast, a beggar asked for food and clothing.
Martin had but his own cloak, and this he forthwith
tore in half and gave one portion to the
beggar. Later on the same night there came
a knocking at Martin's door; the snow had
ceased falling and the stars shone brightly, and
one of goodly presence stood with the cloak
on his arm, saying, "I was naked and ye
clothed me." Martin straightway became a
priest of the church, and died an honoured
bishop of Tours, and for ever after the anniversary
of his conversion is celebrated by
sunny skies.</p>

<p>We owe a double debt to St. Martin. We
have to thank him for the saying, "<i>All my
eye</i>" and the words "<i>chapel</i>" and "<i>chaplain</i>."
The full form of the phrase, "<i>All my
eye and Betty Martin</i>," which we all of us have
often heard, is an obvious corruption of "<i>O
mihi beate Martine</i>," the beginning of an invocation
to the saint. The cloak he divided with
a naked beggar, which, by the way, took place
at Amiens, not at Tours, was treasured as a
relic by the Frankish kings, borne before them
in battle, and brought forth when solemn oaths
were to be taken. The guardians of this cloak<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">211</a></span>
or cape were known as "<i>cappellani</i>," whence
"<i>chaplain</i>," while its sanctuary or "<i>cappella</i>"
has become "<i>chapel</i>."</p>

<p>For their descriptions of Plessis-les-Tours
modern English travellers have invariably
turned to the pages of Sir Walter Scott. This
is all very well in its way, but it is also well
to remember that Scott drew his picture from
definite information, and it is not merely the
product of his imaginary architectural skill.
In this respect Scott was certainly far ahead
of Carlyle in his estimates of French matters.</p>

<p>"Even in those days" (writing of "Quentin
Durward"), said Scott, "when the great
found themselves obliged to reside in places of
fortified strength, it" (Plessis-les-Tours)
"was distinguished for the extreme and jealous
care with which it was watched and defended."
All this is substantiated and corroborated by
authorities, and, while it may have been chosen
by Scott merely as a suitable accessory for the
details of his story, Plessis-les-Tours unquestionably
was a royal stronghold of such proportions
as to be but meanly suggested by the
scanty remains of the present day.</p>

<p>Louis XI. dreamed fondly of Plessis-les-Tours
(Plessis being from the Latin <i>Plexitium</i>,
a name borne by many suburban villages of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">212</a></span>
France), and he sought to make it a royal residence
where he should be safe from every outward
harm. It had four great towers, crenelated
and machicolated, after the best Gothic
fortresses of the time. At the four angles of
the protecting walls were the principal logis,
and between the lines of its ramparts or fosses
was an advance-guard of buildings presumably
intended for the vassals in time of danger.</p>

<p>This was the castle as Louis first knew it,
when it was the property of the chamberlain
of the Duchy of Luynes, from whom the king
bought it for five thousand and five hundred
<i>écus d'or</i>,&mdash;the value of fifty thousand francs
of to-day.</p>

<p>Its former appellation, Montilz-les-Tours,
was changed (1463) to Plessis. All the chief
features have disappeared, and to-day it is but
a scrappy collection of tumble-down buildings
devoted to all manner of purposes. A few
fragmentary low-roofed vaults are left, and
a brick and stone building, flanked by an octagonal
tower, containing a stairway; but this is
about all of the former edifice, which, if not as
splendid as some other royal residences, was
quite as effectively defended and as suitable to
its purposes as any.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213"></a></span></p>

<div class="figright">
<img src="images/illus275_small.jpg" alt="Plessis-Les-Tours In the time of Louis XI" title="Plessis-Les-Tours In the time of Louis XI" />
<div class="caption"><a href="images/illus275.jpg">
<i>Plessis-Les-Tours In the time of Louis XI</i></a></div>
</div>



<p>It had, too, within its walls a tiny chapel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">214</a></span>
dedicated to Our Lady of Cléry, before whose
altar the superstitious Louis made his inconstant
devotions.</p>

<p>Once a great forest surrounded the château,
and was, as Scott says, "rendered dangerous
and well-nigh impracticable by snares and
traps armed with scythe-blades, which shred
off the unwary traveller's limbs ... and calthrops
that would pierce your foot through,
and pitfalls deep enough to bury you in them
for ever." To-day the forest has disappeared,
"lost in the night of time," as a French historian
has it.</p>

<p>The detailed description in "Quentin Durward"
is, however, as good as any, and, if one
has no reference works in French by him, he
may well read the dozen or more pages which
Sir Walter devotes to the further description
of the castle.</p>

<p>Perhaps, after all, it is fitting that a Scot
should have written so enthusiastically of it,
for the castle itself was guarded by the Scottish
archers, "to the number of three hundred
gentlemen of the best blood of Scotland."</p>

<p>An anonymous poet has written of the ancient
glory of this retreat of Louis's as follows:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">215</a></span></p>


<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0_5">"Un imposant château se présente à la vue,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Par des portes de fer l'entrée est défendue;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Les murs en sont épais et les fossés profonds;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On y voit des créneaux, des tours, des bastions,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Et des soldats armés veillent sur ses murailles."<br /></span>
</div></div>


<p>Frame this with such details as the surrounding
country supplies, the Cher on one side, the
Loire on the other, and the fertile hills of St.
Cyr, of Ballon, and of Joué, and one has a
picture worthy of the greatest painter of any
time.</p>

<p>Louis XI. died at Plessis, after having lived
there many years. Louis XII. made of it a
<i>rendezvous de chasse</i>, but François II. confided
its care to a governor and would never live
in it. Louis XIV. gave the governorship as
a hereditary perquisite to the widow of the
Seigneur de Sausac.</p>

<p>In 1778 it was used as a sort of retreat for
the indigent, though happily enough Touraine
was never overburdened with this class of humanity.
Under Louis XV. a Mademoiselle Deneux,
a momentary rival of La Pompadour and
Du Barry, found a retreat here. Later it became
a <i>maison de correction</i>, and finally a
<i>dépôt militaire</i>. At the time of the Revolution
it was declared to be national property, and on
the <i>nineteenth Nivoise, Year IV.</i>, Citizen Cormeri,
justice of the peace at Tours, fixed its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">216</a></span>
value at one hundred and thirty-one thousand
francs.</p>

<p>To-day it is as bare and uncouth as a mere
barracks or as a disused flour-mill, and its ruins
are visited partly because of their former historical
glories, as recalled by students of
French history, and partly because of the
glamour which was shed over it, for English
readers, by Scott.</p>

<p>Sixty years ago a French writer deplored the
fact that, on leaving these scanty remains of a
so long gone past, he observed a notice nailed
to a pillar of the <i>porte-cochère</i> reading:</p>

<div class="box1">
<div style="text-align: right">LA FERME DU PLESSIS</div><br />
<div style="text-align: left">O LOUER OU A VENDRE</div>
</div>

<p>To-day some sort of a division and rearrangement
of the property has been made, but
the result is no less mournful and sad, and thus
a glorious page of the annals of France has
become blurred.</p>

<p>It is interesting to recall what manner of
persons composed the household of Louis XI.
when he resided at Plessis-les-Tours. Commines,
his historian, has said that habitually
it consisted of a chancellor, a <i>juge de l'hôtel</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">217</a></span>
a private secretary, and a treasurer, each having
under him various employees. In addition
there was a master of the pantry, a cupbearer,
a <i>chef de bouche</i> and a <i>chef de cuisine</i>, a <i>fruitier</i>,
a master of the horse, a quartermaster
or master-at-arms, and, in immediate control of
these domestic servants, a <i>seneschal</i> or <i>grand
maître</i>. In many respects the household was
not luxuriously conducted, for the parsimonious
Louis lived fully up to the false maxim:
"<i>Qui peu donne, beaucoup recueille.</i>"</p>

<p>Louis himself was fond of doing what the
modern housewife would call "messing about
in the kitchen." He did not dabble at cookery
as a pastime, or that sort of thing; but rather
he kept an eagle eye on the whole conduct of
the affairs of the household.</p>

<p>One day, coming to the kitchen <i>en négligé</i>,
he saw a small boy turning a spit before the
fire.</p>

<p>"And what might you be called?" said he,
patting the lad on the shoulder.</p>

<p>"Etienne," replied the <i>marmiton</i>.</p>

<p>"Thy <i>pays</i>, my lad?"</p>

<p>"Le Berry."</p>

<p>"Thy age?"</p>

<p>"Fifteen, come St. Martin's."</p>

<p>"Thy wish?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">218</a></span></p>

<p>"To be as great as the king" (he had not
recognized his royal master).</p>

<p>"And what wishes the king?"</p>

<p>"His expenses to become less."</p>

<p>The reply brought good fortune for the lad,
for Louis made him his <i>valet de chambre</i>, and
took him afterward into his most intimate confidence.</p>

<p>Louis was fond of <i>la chasse</i>, and Scott does
not overlook this fact in "Quentin Durward."
When affairs of state did not press, it was the
king's greatest pleasure. For the royal hunt no
pains or expense were spared. The carriages
were without an equal elsewhere in the courts
of Europe, and the hunting establishment was
equipped with <i>chiens courants</i> from Spain,
<i>levriers</i> from Bretagne, <i>bassets</i> from Valence,
mules from Sicily, and horses from Naples.</p>

<p>The attractions of the environs of Tours are
many and interesting: St. Symphorien, Varennes,
the Grottoes of Ste. Radegonde, and the
site of that most famous abbey of Marmoutier,
also a foundation of St. Martin. Here, under
the name Martinus Monasterium, grew up an
immense and superb establishment. From an
old seventeenth-century print one quotes the
following couplet:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">219</a></span></p>

<div class="figright">
<a href="images/illus281.jpg">

</a>
</div>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0_5">"De quel côté que le vent vente<br /></span>
<span class="i0_5">Marmoutier a cens et rente."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>From this one infers that the abbey's original
functions are performed no more.</p>

<p>In the middle ages (thirteenth century) it
was one of the most powerful institutions of its
class, and its church one of the most beautiful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">220</a></span>
in Touraine. The tower and donjon are the
only substantial remains of this early edifice.</p>

<p>A curious chapel, called the "Chapelle des
Sept Dormants," is here cut in the form of a
cross into the rock of the hillside, where are
buried the remains of the Seven Sleepers,
the disciples of St. Martin, who, as the holy
man had predicted, all died on the same day.</p>

<p>Beyond Marmoutier, a stairway of 122 steps,
cut also in the rock, leads to the plateau on
which stands the gaunt and ugly Lanterne de
Rochecorbon, a fourteenth-century construction
with a crenelated summit, an unlovely
companion of that even more enigmatic erection
known as "La Pile," a few miles down
the Loire at Cinq-Mars.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">221</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER XI.<span class="pagenum"><a href="#Contents">To ToC</a></span></h2>

<h4>LUYNES AND LANGEAIS</h4>


<p>Below Tours, and before reaching Saumur,
are a succession of panoramic surprises which
are only to be likened to those of our imagination,
but they are very real nevertheless.</p>

<p>As one leaves Tours by the road which skirts
the right bank of the Loire, he is once more
impressed by the fact that the <i>cailloux de Loire</i>
are the river's chief product, though fried fish,
of a similar variety to those found in the Seine,
are found on the menus of all roadside taverns
and restaurants.</p>

<p>Still, the effect of the uncovered bed of the
Loire, with its variegated pebbles and mirror-like
pools, is infinitely more picturesque than if
it were mud flats, and its tree-bordered banks
are for ever opening great alleyed vistas such
as are only known in France.</p>

<p>The hills on either bank are not of the stupendous
and magnificently scenic order of those
of the Seine above and below Rouen; but, such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">222</a></span>
as they are, they are of much the same composition,
a soft talcy formation which here
serves admirably the purposes of cliff-dwellings
for the vineyard and wine-press workers,
who form practically the sole population of the
Loire villages from Vouvray, just above Tours,
to Saumur far below.</p>

<p>On the hillsides are the vineyards themselves,
growing out of the thin layer of soil
in shades of red and brown and golden, which
no artist has ever been able to copy, for no
one has painted the rich colouring of a vineyard
in a manner at all approaching the original.</p>

<p>Not far below Tours, on the right bank, rise
the towers and turrets of the Château de
Luynes, hanging perilously high above the lowland
which borders upon the river. An unpleasant
tooting tram gives communication a
dozen times a day with Tours, but few, apparently,
patronize it except peasants with market-baskets,
and vineyard workers going into town
for a jollification. It is perhaps just as well,
for the fine little town of Luynes, which takes
its name from the château which has been the
residence of a Comte de Luynes since the days
of Louis XIII., would be quite spoiled if it were
on the beaten track.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">223</a></span></p>


<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/illus285_small.jpg" alt="A Vineyard of Vouvray" title="A Vineyard of Vouvray" />
<div class="caption"><a href="images/illus285.jpg"><i>A Vineyard of Vouvray</i></a></div>
</div>



<p>The brusque façade of the Château de Luynes
makes a charming interior, judging from the
descriptions and drawings which are to be met
with in an elaborately prepared volume devoted
to its history.</p>

<p>The stranger is allowed to enter within the
gates of the courtyard, beneath the grim coiffed
towers; but he may visit only certain apartments.
He will, however, see enough to indicate
that the edifice was something more than
a mere <i>maison de campagne</i>. All the attributes
of an important fortress are here, great, round,
thickly built towers, with but few exterior windows,
and those high up from the ground.
There is nothing of luxurious elegance about
it, and its aspect is forbidding, though imposing.</p>

<p>The château belies its looks somewhat, for it
was built only in the fifteenth and sixteenth
centuries, when, in most of its neighbours, the
more or less florid Renaissance was in vogue.
A Renaissance structure in stone and brick
forms a part of that which faces on the interior
court, and is flanked by a fine octagonal "<i>tour
d'escalier</i>."</p>

<p>From the terrace of the courtyard one gets
an impressive view of the Loire, which glides
by two or more kilometres away, and of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">224</a></span>
towers and roof-tops of Tours, and the vine-carpeted
hills which stretch away along the
river's bank in either direction.</p>

<p>The château of Luynes is still in the possession
of a Duc de Luynes, through whose courtesy
one may visit such of the apartments as
his servants are allowed to show. It is not
so great an exhibition, nor so good a one, as
is to be had at Langeais; but it is satisfactory
as far as it goes, and, when it is supplemented
by the walks and views which are to be had
on the plateau, upon which the grim-towered
château sits, the memory of it all becomes most
pleasurable.</p>

<p>The former Ducs de Luynes were continually
appearing in the historic events of the later
Renaissance period, but it was only with
Louis XIII., he who would have put France
under the protection of the Virgin, that the
chatelain of Luynes came to a position of real
power. Louis made Albert, the Gascon, both
Duc de Luynes and Connétable de France, and
thereby gave birth to a tyrant whom he hated
and feared, as he did his mother, his wife, and
his minister, Richelieu.</p>

<div class="caption"><a href="images/illus289.jpg"><i>Mediæval Stairway and the Château de Luynes</i></a></div>
</div>

<p>The site occupied by the château of Luynes
is truly marvellous, though, as a matter of fact,
there is no great magnificence about the pro<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">225</a></span>portions
of the château itself. It is piled gracefully
on the top of a table-land which rises
abruptly from the Loire and has a charmingly
quaint old town nestled confidingly below it,
as if for protection.</p>

<p>One reaches the château by any one of a half-dozen
methods, by the highroad which bends
around in hairpin curves until it reaches the
plateau above, by various paths across or
around the vineyards of the hillside, or by a
quaintly cut mediæval stairway, levelled and
terraced in the gravelly soil until it ends just
beneath the frowning walls of the château itself.
From this point one gets quite the most imposing
aspect of the château to be had, its towers
and turrets piercing the sky high above the
head, and carrying the mind back to the days
when civilization meant something more&mdash;or
less&mdash;than it does to-day, with the toot of a
steam-tram down below on the river's bank
and the midday whistles of the factories of
Tours rending one's ears the moment he forgets
the past and recalls the present.</p>

<p>To-day the Château de Luynes is modern,
at least to the extent that it is lived in, and has
all the refinements of a modern civilization;
but one does not realize all this from an exterior
contemplation, and only as one strolls<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">226</a></span>
through the apartments publicly shown, and
gets glimpses of electrical conveniences and
modern arrangements, does he wonder how far
different it may have been before all this came
to pass.</p>

<p>Built in early Renaissance times, the château
has all the peculiarities of the feudal period,
when window-openings were few and far between,
and high up above the level of the pavement.
In feudal and warlike times this often
proved an admirable feature; but one would
have thought that, with the beginning of the
Renaissance, a more ample provision would
have been made for the admission of sunshine.</p>

<p>The <i>chef-d'&#339;uvre</i> of this really great architectural
monument is undoubtedly the façade
of the beautiful fifteenth-century courtyard.
There is nothing even remotely feudal here,
but a purely decorative effect which is as
charming in its way as is the exterior façade
of Azay-le-Rideau. "A poem," it has been
called, "in weather-worn timber and stone,"
and the simile could hardly be improved upon.</p>

<p>The town, too, or such of it as immediately
adjoins the château, is likewise charming and
quaint, and sleepily indolent as far as any great
activity is concerned.</p>

<p>Luynes was the seat of a seigneurie until<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">227</a></span>
1619, when it became a possession of the Comte
de Maillé. Finally it came to Charles d'Albert,
known as "D'Albert de Luynes," a former
page to Henri IV., who afterward became the
favourite and the Guardian of the Seals of
Louis XIV.; and thus the earlier foundation
of Maillé became known as Luynes.</p>

<p>Except for its old houses of wood and stone,
its old wooden market-house, and its tortuous
streets of stairs, there are few features here,
except the château, which take rank as architectural
monuments of worth. The church is
a modern structure, built after the Romanesque
manner and wholly without warmth and feeling.</p>

<p>From the height on which stands the château
of Luynes one sees, as his eye follows the
course of the Loire to the southwestward, the
gaunt, unbeautiful "Pile" of Cinq-Mars. The
origin of this singular square tower, looking
for all the world like a factory chimney or some
great ventilating-shaft, is lost far back in Carlovingian,
or perhaps Roman, times. It is a
mystery to archæologists and antiquarians,
some claiming it to be a military monument,
others a beacon by land, and yet others believing
it to be of some religious significance.</p>

<p>At all events, all the explanations ignore the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">228</a></span>
four <i>pyramidions</i> of its topmost course, and
these, be it remarked, are quite the most curious
feature of the whole fabric.</p>

<p>To many the name of the little town of Cinq-Mars
will suggest that of the Marquis de Cinq-Mars,
a court favourite of Louis XIII. It was
the ambitious but unhappy career at court of
this young gallant which ultimately resulted in
his death on the scaffold, and in the razing,
by Richelieu, of his ancestral residence, the
castle of Cinq-Mars, "to the heights of infamy."
The expression is a curious one, but
history so records it. All that is left to-day
to remind one of the stronghold of the D'Effiats
of Cinq-Mars are its two crumbling gate-towers
with an arch between and a few fragmentary
foundation walls which follow the
summit of the cliff behind "La Pile."</p>

<p>The little town of not more than a couple
of thousand inhabitants nestles in a bend of the
Loire, where there is so great a breadth that
it looks like a long-drawn-out lake. The low
hills, so characteristic of these parts, stretch
themselves on either bank, unbroken except
where some little streamlet forces its way by
a gentle ravine through the scrubby undergrowth.
Oaks and firs and huge limestone
cliffs jut out from the top of the hillside on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">229</a></span>
the right bank and shelter the town which lies
below.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/illus295_small.jpg" alt="Ruins of Cinq-Mars" title="Ruins of Cinq-Mars" />
<div class="caption"><a href="images/illus295.jpg"><i>Ruins of Cinq-Mars</i></a></div>
</div>




<p>Cinq-Mars is a miniature metropolis, though
not a very progressive one at first sight; indeed,
beyond its long main street and its houses,
which cluster about its grim, though beautiful,
tenth and twelfth century church, there are few
signs of even provincial importance.</p>

<p>In reality Cinq-Mars is the centre of a large
and important wine industry, where you may
hear discussed, at the <i>table d'hôte</i> of its not
very readily found little inn, the poor prices
which the usually abundant crop always brings.
The native even bewails the fact that he is not
blessed with a poor season or two and then he
would be able to sell his fine vintages for something
more than three sous a litre. By the time
it reaches Paris this <i>vin de Touraine</i> of commerce
has aggrandized itself so that it commands
two francs fifty centimes on the Boulevards,
and a franc fifty in the University
quarter.</p>

<p>The fall of Henri Cinq-Mars was most
pathetic, though no doubt moralists will claim
that because of his covetous ambitions he deserved
nothing better.</p>

<p>He went up to Paris from Touraine, a boy of
twenty, and was presented to the king, who was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">230</a></span>
immediately impressed by his distinguished
manners. From infancy Cinq-Mars had been a
lover of life in the open. He had hunted the
forests of Touraine, and had angled the waters
of the Loire, and thus he came to give a new
zest to the already sad life of Louis XIII.
Honour after honour was piled upon him until
he was made Grand Seneschal of France and
Master of the King's Horse, at which time he
dropped his natal patronymic and became
known as "Monsieur le Grand."</p>

<p>Cinq-Mars fell madly in love with Marion
Delorme and wished to make her "Madame
la Grande," but the dowager Marquise de Cinq-Mars
would not hear of it: Mlle. Marion Delorme,
the Aspasia of her day, would be no
honour to the ancestral tree of the Effiats of
Cinq-Mars.</p>

<p>Headstrong and wilful, one early morning,
Monsieur le Grand and his beloved, then only
thirty, took coach from her hotel in the Rue des
Tournelles at Paris for the old family castle
in Touraine, sitting high on the hills above the
feudal village which bore the name of Cinq-Mars.
In the chapel they were secretly married,
and for eight days the proverbial marriage-bell
rang true. Their Nemesis appeared
on the ninth day in the person of the dowager,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">231</a></span>
and Cinq-Mars told his mother that the whole
affair was simply a <i>passe temps</i>, and that
Mlle. Delorme was still Mlle. Delorme. His
mother would not be deceived, however, and she
flew for succour to Richelieu, who himself was
more than slightly acquainted with the charms
of the fair Marion.</p>

<p>This was Cinq-Mars's downfall. He advised
the king "by fair means or foul, let Richelieu
die," and the king listened. A conspiracy was
formed, by Cinq-Mars and others, to do away
with the cardinal, <i>and even the king</i>, at whose
death Gaston of Orleans was to be proclaimed
regent for his nephew, the infant Louis XIV.</p>

<p>The court went to Narbonne, on the Mediterranean,
that it might be near aid from Spain;
all of which was a subterfuge of Cinq-Mars.
The rest moves quickly: Richelieu discovered
the plot; Cinq-Mars attempted to flee disguised
as a Spaniard, was captured and brought as a
prisoner to the castle at Montpellier.</p>

<p>Richelieu had proved the more powerful of
the two; but he was dying, and this is the reason,
perhaps, why he hurried matters. Cinq-Mars,
"the amiable criminal," went to the torture-chamber,
and afterward to the scaffold.</p>

<p>"Then," say the old chronicles, "Richelieu
ordered that the feudal castle of Cinq-Mars, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">232</a></span>
the valley of the Loire, should be blown up, and
the towers razed to the height of infamy."</p>

<p>From Cinq-Mars to Langeais, whose château
is really one of the most appealing sights of the
Loire, the characteristics of the country are
topographically and economically the same;
green hills slope, vine-covered, to the river,
with here and there a tiny rivulet flowing into
the greater stream.</p>

<p>As at Cinq-Mars, the chief commodity of
Langeais is wine, rich, red wine and pale
amber, too, but all of it wine of a quality and
at a price which would make the city-dweller
envious indeed.</p>

<p>There are two distinct châteaux at Langeais;
at least, there is <i>the</i> château, and just beyond
the ornamental stone-carpet of its courtyard
are the ruins of one of the earliest donjons, or
keeps, in all France. It dates from the year
990, and was built by the celebrated Comte
d'Anjou, Foulques Nerra, "<i>un criminel dévoyé
des hommes et de Dieu</i>," whose hobby, evidently,
was building châteaux, as his "follies"
in stone are said to have encumbered the land
in those old days.</p>

<p>Taken and retaken, dismantled and in part
razed in the fifteenth century, it gave place to
the present château by the orders of Louis XI.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">233</a></span></p>

<div class="figright">
<img src="images/illus301_small.jpg" alt="Château de Langeais" title="Château de Langeais" />
<div class="caption"><a href="images/illus301.jpg"><i>Château de Langeais</i></a></div>
</div>




<p>The Château de Langeais of to-day is a
robust example of its kind; its walls, flanked
by great hooded towers, have a surrounding
"<i>guette</i>," or gallery, which served as a means
of communication from one part of the establishment
to another and, in warlike times, allowed
boiling oil or melted lead, or whatever
they may have used for the purpose, to be
poured down upon the heads of any besiegers
who had the audacity to attack it.</p>

<p>There is no glacis or moat, but the machicolations,
sixty feet or more up from the ground,
must have afforded a well-nigh perfect means
of repelling a near attack.</p>

<p>Altogether Langeais is a redoubtable little
château of the period, and its aspect to-day has
changed but very little. "It is the swan-song
of expiring feudalism," said the Abbé Bosseb&#339;uf.</p>

<p>One gets a thrill of heroic emotion when he
views its hardy walls for the first time: "a
mountain of stone, a heroic poem of Gothic
art," it has with reason been called.</p>

<p>Jean Bourré, the minister of Louis XI., built
the present château about 1460. The chief
events of its history were the drawing up
within its walls of the "common law" of Touraine,
by the order of Charles VII., and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">234</a></span>
marriage of Charles VIII. with Anne de Bretagne,
on the 16th of December, 1491.</p>

<p>The land belonged, in 1276, to Pierre de
Brosse, the minister of Philippe-le-Hardi;
later, to François d'Orleans, son of the celebrated
<i>Bâtard</i>; to the Princesse de Conti,
daughter of the Duc de Guise; to the families
Du Bellay and D'Effiats, Barons of Cinq-Mars;
and, finally, to the Duc de Luynes, in whose
hands it remained up to the Revolution.</p>

<p>Honoré de Balzac, who may well be called
one of the historians of Touraine, gave to
one of his heroines the name of Langeais. To-day,
however, the family of Langeais does not
exist, and, indeed, according to the chronicles,
never had any connection with either the donjon
of Foulques Nerra or the château of the
fifteenth century. The present owner is M.
Jacques Siegfreid, who has admirably restored
and furnished it after the Gothic style of the
middle ages.</p>

<p>The château of Langeais, like that of Chenonceaux,
is occupied, as one learns from a visit
to its interior. A lackey of a superior order
receives you; you pay a franc for an admission
ticket, and the lackey conducts you through
nearly, if not quite all, of the apartments.
Where the family goes during this process it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">235</a></span>
hard to say, but doubtless they are willing to
inconvenience themselves for the benefit of
"touring" humanity.</p>

<p>The interior, no less than the exterior,
impresses one as being something which has lived
in the past, and yet exists to-day in all its
original glory, for the present proprietor, with the
aid of an admirable adviser, M. Lucien Roy, a
Parisian architect, has produced a resemblance
of its former furnishings which, so far as it
goes, is beyond criticism.</p>

<p>There is nothing of bareness about it, nor is
there an over-luxuriant interpolation of irrelevant
things, such as a curator crowds into a
museum. In short, nothing more has been done
than to attempt to reconstitute a habitation
of the fifteenth century. For seventeen years
the work has gone on, and there have been collected
many authentic furnishings contemporary
with the fabric itself, great oaken beds,
tables, chairs, benches, tapestries, and other
articles. In addition, the decorations have
been carried out after the same manner, copied
in many cases from contemporary pictures and
prints.</p>

<p>To-day, the general aspect is that of a peaceful
household, with all recollections of feudal
times banished for ever. All is tranquil, re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">236</a></span>spectable,
and luxurious, and it would take a
chronic faultfinder not to be content with the
manner with which these admirable restorations
and refurnishings have been carried out.</p>

<p>One notes particularly the infinite variety
and appropriateness of the tiling which goes
to make up the floors of these great salons&mdash;modern
though it is. The great chimneypieces,
however, are ancient, and have not been
retouched. Those in the Salle des Gardes and
the Salle where was celebrated the marriage
of Charles VIII. and Anne de Bretagne, with
their ornamentation in the best of Gothic, are
especially noteworthy.</p>

<p>This latter apartment is the chief attraction
of the château and the room of which the present
dwellers in this charming monument of
history are naturally the most proud. To-day
it forms the great dining-hall of the establishment.
Mementos of this marriage, so momentous
for France, are exceedingly numerous
along the lower Loire, but this handsome room
quite leads them all. This marriage, and the
goods and lands it brought to the Crown, had
but one stipulation connected with it, and that
was that the Duchesse Anne should be privileged
to marry the elderly king's successor,
should she survive her royal husband.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">237</a></span></p>



<div class="figleft"><a href="images/illus307.jpg">
<img src="images/illus307_small.jpg" alt="Arms of Louis XII. and Anne de Bretagne at the time of their marriage" title="Arms of Louis XII. and Anne de Bretagne at the time of their marriage" /></a>
</div>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">238</a></span>Louis XII. was not at all opposed to becoming
the husband of la Duchesse Anne after
Charles VIII. had met his death on the tennis-court,
because this second marriage would for
ever bind to France that great province ruled
by the gentle Anne.</p>

<p>In the Salle des Gardes are six valuable
tapestries representing such heroic figures as
Cæsar and Charlemagne, surrounded by their
companions in arms.</p>

<p>From the towers, on a clear day, one may see
the pyramids of the cathedral at Tours rising
on the horizon to the northward. Below is the
Château de Villandry, where Philippe-Auguste
met Henry II. of England to conclude a memorable
peace. To the right is Azay-le-Rideau,
and to the extreme right are the ruined towers
of Cinq-Mars and its Pile. Nothing could be
more delicious on a bright summer's day than
the view from the ramparts of Langeais over
the roof-tops of the charming little town in the
foreground.</p>

<p>Some time after the Revolution there was
found, in the gardens of the château, the
remains of a <i>chapelle romaine</i> which historians,
who have searched the annals of antiquity in
Touraine, claim to have been the chapel in honour
of St. Sauveur which Foulques V., called<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">239</a></span>
le Jeune, one of the five Counts of Anjou of that
name, constructed upon his return from his
voyage to Palestine in the twelfth century.
To-day it is overgrown with a trellised grapevine
and is practically not visible, still it is
another architectural monument of the first
rank with which the not very ample domain
of the Château de Langeais is endowed.</p>

<p>From the courtyard the walls of the château
take on a Renaissance aspect; a tiny doorway
beside the great gate is manifestly Renaissance;
so, too, are the polygonal towers, with
their winding stairs, the pignons and gables
of the roof, and what carved stone there is in
evidence. Three stone stairways which mount
by the slender <i>tourelles</i> serve to communicate
with the various floors to-day as they did in the
times of Charles VIII.</p>

<p>The courtyard itself, with its formal carpet
design in stone, its shaded walls, its stone
seats, and its Roman sarcophagus, is a pleasant
retreat, but it has not the seclusion of the larger
park, delightful though it is.</p>

<p>Just before the drawbridge of the old château,
that mediæval gateway by which one enters
to-day, one sees the Maison de Rabelais,
who is the deity of Langeais and Chinon, as is
Balzac that of Tours. It is a fine old-time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">240</a></span>
house of a certain amplitude and grandeur
among its less splendid fellows, now given over,
on the ground floor, to a bakery and pastry-shop.
Enough is left of its original aspect,
and the Renaissance decorations of its façade
are sufficiently well preserved to stamp it as a
worthy abode for the "Curé de Chinon," who
lived here for some years.</p>

<p>Two other names in literature are connected
with Langeais: Ronsard, the poet, who lived
here for a time, and César-Alexis-Chichereau,
Chevalier de la Barre, who was a poet and a
troubadour of repute.</p>

<p>The main street of Langeais is still flanked
with good Gothic and Renaissance houses,
neither pretentious nor mean, but of that order
which sets off to great advantage the walls and
towers and porches of the château and the
church. This street follows the ancient Roman
roadway which traversed the valley of the
Loire through Gaul.</p>

<p>The river is here crossed by one of those
too frequent, though useful, suspension-bridges,
with which the Loire abounds. The guide-books
call it <i>beau</i>, but it is not. One has to
cross it to reach Azay-le-Rideau, which lies ten
kilometres or more away across the Indre.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">241</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER XII.<span class="pagenum"><a href="#Contents">To ToC</a></span></h2>

<h4>AZAY-LE-RIDEAU, USSÉ, AND CHINON</h4>


<p>From Langeais, one's obvious route lies
towards Chinon, via Azay-le-Rideau and Ussé.
These latter are practically within the forest,
though the Forêt de Chinon proper does not
actually begin until one leaves Azay behind,
when for twenty kilometres or more one of the
most superb forest roads in France crosses
many hills and dales until it finally descends
into Chinon itself.</p>

<p>Like most forest roads in France, this highway
is not flat; it rises and falls with a sheer
that is sometimes precipitous, but always with
a gravelled surface that gives little dust, and
which absorbs water as the sand from the
pounce-box of our forefathers dried up ink.
This simile calls to mind the fact that in twentieth-century
France the pounce-box is still in
use, notably at wayside railway stations, where
the agent writes you out your ticket and dries
it off in a box, not of sand, but of sawdust.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">242</a></span></p>

<p>To partake of the hospitality of Azay-le-Rideau
one must arrive before four in the
afternoon, and not earlier than midday. From
the photographs and post-cards by which one
has become familiar with Azay-le-Rideau, it
appears like a great country house sitting by
itself far away from any other habitation. In
England this is often the case, in France but
seldom.</p>

<p>Clustered around the walls of the not very
great park which surrounds the château are
all manner of shops and cafés, not of the tourist
order,&mdash;for there is very little here to suggest
that tourists ever come, though indeed
they do, by twos and threes throughout all the
year,&mdash;but for the accommodation of the
population of the little town itself, which must
approximate a couple of thousand souls, all
of whom appear to be engaged in the culture
of the vine and its attendant pursuits, as the
wine-presses, the coopers' shops, and other
similar establishments plainly show. There is,
moreover, the pleasant smell of fermented
grape-juice over all, which, like the odour of
the hop-fields of Kent, is conducive to sleep;
and there lies the charm of Azay-le-Rideau,
which seems always half-asleep.</p>

<p>The Hôtel du Grand Monarque is a wonder<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">243</a></span>fully
comfortable country inn, with a dining-room
large enough to accommodate half a hundred
persons, but which, most likely, will serve
only yourself. One incongruous note is
sounded,&mdash;convenient though it be,&mdash;and that
is the electric light which illuminates the hotel
and its dependencies, including the stables,
which look as though they might once have
been a part of a mediæval château themselves.</p>

<p>However, since posting days and tallow dips
have gone for ever, one might as well content
himself with the superior civilization which
confronts him, and be comfortable at least.</p>

<p>The Château d'Azay-le-Rideau is one of the
gems of Touraine's splendid collection of Renaissance
art treasures, though by no means is
it one of the grandest or most imposing.</p>

<p>A tree-lined avenue leads from the village
street to the château, which sits in the midst
of a tiny park; not a grand expanse as at Chambord
or Chenonceaux, but a sort of green frame
with a surrounding moat, fed by the waters
of the Indre.</p>

<p>The main building is square, with a great
coiffed round tower at each corner. The Abbé
Chevalier, in his "Promenades Pittoresques
en Touraine," called it the purest and best of
French Renaissance, and such it assuredly is,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">244</a></span>
if one takes a not too extensive domestic establishment
of the early years of the sixteenth
century as the typical example.</p>

<p>Undoubtedly the sylvan surroundings of the
château have a great deal to do with the effectiveness
of its charms. The great white walls
of its façade, with the wonderful sculptures
of Jean Goujon, glisten in the brilliant sunlight
of Touraine through the sycamores and willows
which border the Indre in a genuinely romantic
fashion.</p>

<p>Somewhere within the walls are the remains
of an old tower of the one-time fortress which
was burned by the Dauphin Charles in 1418,
after, says history, "he had beheaded its governor
and taken all of the defenders to the
number of three hundred and thirty-four."
This act was in revenge for an alleged insult
to his sacred person.</p>

<p>There are no remains of this former tower
visible exteriorly to-day, and no other bloody
acts appear to have attached themselves to the
present château in all the four hundred years
of its existence.</p>

</div>

<p>Gilles Berthelot erected the present structure
early in the reign of François I. He was a
man close to the king in affairs of state, first
<i>conseiller-secrétaire</i>, then <i>trésorier-général des<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">245</a></span>
finances</i>, hence he knew the value of money.
Among the succeeding proprietors was Guy de
Saint Gelais, one of the most accomplished
diplomats of his time. He was followed by
Henri de Beringhem, who built the stables and
ornamented the great room known as the
Chambre du Roi from the fact that Louis XIV.
once slept there, with the magnificent paintings
which are shown to-day.</p>

<p>Everywhere is there a rich, though not gross,
display of decoration, beginning with such constructive
details as the pointed-roofed <i>tourelles</i>,
which are themselves exceedingly decorative.
The doors, windows, roof-tops, chimneypieces,
and the semi-enclosed circular stairways are
all elaborately sculptured after the best manner
of the time.</p>

<p>The entrance portico is a wonder of its kind,
with a strong sculptured arcade and arched
window-openings and niches filled with bas-reliefs.
Sculptured shells, foliage, and mythological
symbols combine to form an arabesque,
through which are interspersed the favourite
ciphers of the region, the ermine and the salamander,
which go to prove that François and
other royalties must at one time or another
have had some connection with the château.</p>

<p>History only tells us, however, that Gilles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">246</a></span>
Berthelot was a king's minister and Mayor
of Tours. Perhaps he thought of handing it
over as a gift some day in exchange for further
honours. His device bore the words, <i>"Ung
Seul Desir,"</i> which may or may not have had
a special significance.</p>

<p>The interior of the edifice is as beautiful as
is its exterior, and is furnished with that luxuriance
of decorative effect so characteristic of
the best era of the Renaissance in France.</p>

<p>Until recently the proprietor was the Marquis
de Biencourt, who, like his fellow proprietors
of châteaux in Touraine, generously gave
visitors an opportunity to see his treasure-house
for themselves, and, moreover, furnished
a guide who was something more than a menial
and yet not a supercilious functionary.</p>

<p>Within a twelvemonth this "purest joy of
the French Renaissance" was put upon the
real estate market, with the result that it might
have fallen into unappreciative hands, or, what
a Touraine antiquarian told the writer would
be the worse fate that could possibly befall it,
might be bought up by some American millionaire,
who through the services of the house-breaker
would dismantle it and remove it stone
by stone and set it up anew on some asphalted
avenue in some western metropolis. This ex<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">247</a></span>traordinary
fear or rumour, whatever it was,
soon passed away and as a "<i>monument historique</i>"
the château has become the property
of the French government.</p>

<p>Less original, perhaps, in plan than Chenonceaux,
less appealing in its <i>ensemble</i> and less
fortunate in its situation, Azay-le-Rideau is
nevertheless entitled to the praises which have
been heaped upon it.</p>

<p>It is but a dozen kilometres from Azay-le-Rideau
to Ussé, on the road to Chinon. The
Château d'Ussé is indeed a big thing; not so
grand as Chambord, nor so winsome as Langeais,
but infinitely more characteristic of what
one imagines a great residential château to
have been like. It belongs to-day to the Comte
de Blacas, and once was the property of Vauban,
Maréchal of France, under Louis XIV.,
who built the terrace which lies between it and
the river, a branch of the Indre.</p>

<p>Perched high above the hemp-lands of the
river-bottom, which here are the most prolific
in the valley of the Indre, the château with its
park of seven hundred or more acres is truly
regal in its appointments and surroundings.
This park extends to the boundary of the
national reservation, the Forêt de Chinon.</p>

<p>The Renaissance château of to-day is a recon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">248</a></span>struction
of the sixteenth century, which preserves,
however, the great cylindrical towers of
a century earlier. Its architecture is on the
whole fantastic, at least as much so as Chambord,
but it is none the less hardy and strong.
Practically it consists of a series of <i>pavillons</i>
bound to the great fifteenth-century donjon
by smaller towers and turrets, all slate-capped
and pointed, with machicolations surrounding
them, and above that a sort of roofed and
crenelated battlement which passes like a
collar around all the outer wall.</p>

<p>The general effect of the exterior walls is
that of a great feudal stronghold, while from
the courtyard the aspect is simply that of a
luxurious Renaissance town house, showing at
least how the two styles can be pleasingly combined.</p>

<p>Crenelated battlements are as old as Pompeii,
so it is doubtful if the feudality of France
did much to increase their use or effectiveness.
They were originally of such dimensions as to
allow a complete shelter for an archer standing
behind one of the uprights. The contrast
to those of a later day, which, virtually nothing
more than a course of decorative stonework,
give no impression of utility, is great, though<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">249</a></span>
here at Ussé they are more pronounced than in
many other similar edifices.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/illus321_small.jpg" alt="Château d&#39;Ussé" title="Château d&#39;Ussé" />
<div class="caption"><a href="images/illus321.jpg"><i>Château d'Ussé</i></a></div>
</div>

<p>The interior arrangements here give due
prominence to a fine staircase, ornamented with
a painting of St. John that is attributed to
Michel Ange.</p>

<p>The Chambre du Roi is hung with ancient
embroideries, and there is a beautiful Renaissance
chapel, above the door of which is a sixteenth-century
bas-relief of the Apostles. Most
of the other great rooms which are shown are
resplendent in oak-beamed ceilings and massive
chimneypieces, always a distinct feature of
Renaissance château-building, and one which
makes modern imitations appear mean and
ugly. To realize this to the full one has only
to recall the dining-room of the pretentious
hotel which huddles under the walls of Amboise.
In a photograph it looks like a regal
banqueting-hall; but in reality it is as tawdry
as stage scenery, with its imitation wainscoted
walls, its imitation beamed ceiling of three-quarter-inch
planks, and its plaster of Paris
fireplace.</p>

<p>Near Ussé is the Château de Rochecotte
which recalls the name of a celebrated chieftain
of the Chouans. It belongs to-day, though
it is not their paternal home, to the family of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">250</a></span>
Castellane, a name which to many is quite as
celebrated and perhaps better known.</p>

<p>The château contains a fine collection of
Dutch paintings of the seventeenth century, and
in its chapel there is a remarkably beautiful
copy of the Sistine Madonna. The name of
Talleyrand is intimately connected with the
occupancy of the château, in pre-revolutionary
times, by Rochecotte.</p>

<p>On the road to Chinon one passes through,
or near, Huismes, which has nothing to stay
one's march but a good twelfth-century church,
which looks as though its doors were never
opened. The Château de la Villaumère, of the
fifteenth century, is near by, and of more than
passing interest are the ruins of the Château
de Bonneventure, built, it is said, by Charles
VII. for Agnes Sorel, who, with all her faults,
stands high in the esteem of most lovers of
French history. At any rate this shrine of
"<i>la belle des belles</i>" is worthy to rank with
that containing her tomb at Loches.</p>

<p>As one enters Chinon by road he meets with
the usual steep decline into a river-valley,
which separates one height from another.
Generally this is the topographic formation
throughout France, and Chinon, with its silent
guardians, the fragments of three non-con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">251</a></span>temporary
castles, all on the same site, is no
exception.</p>

<p>"We never went to Chinon," says Henry
James, in his "Little Tour in France," written
thirty or more years ago. "But one cannot do
everything," he continues, "and I would
rather have missed Chinon than Chenonceaux."
A painter would have put it differently. Chenonceaux
is all that fact and fancy have painted
it, a gem in a perfect setting, and Chinon's
three castles are but mere crumbling walls;
but their environs form a <i>petit pays</i> which will
some day develop into an "artists' sketching-ground,"
in years to come, beside which Etretat,
Moret, Pont Aven, Giverny, and Auvers
will cease to be considered.</p>

<p>At the base of the escarped rock on which
sit the châteaux, or what is left of them, lies
the town of Chinon, with its old houses in
wood and stone and its great, gaunt, but beautiful
churches. Before it flows the Vienne, one
of the most romantically beautiful of all the
secondary rivers of France.</p>

<p>From the <i>castrum romanum</i> of the emperors
to the feudal conquest Chinon played its
due part in the history of Touraine. There
are those who claim that Chinon is a "<i>cité antédiluvienne</i>"
and that it was founded by Cain,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">252</a></span>
who after his crime fled from the paternal malediction
and found a refuge here; and that its
name, at first <i>Caynon</i>, became Chinon. Like
the derivation of most ancient place-names, this
claim involves a wide imagination and assuredly
sounds unreasonable. <i>Caino</i> may, with
more likelihood, have been a Celtic word, meaning
an excavation, and came to be adopted because
of the subterranean quarries from which
the stone was drawn for the building of the
town. The annalists of the western empire
give it as <i>Castrum-Caino</i>, and whether its
origin dates from antediluvian times or not, it
was a town in the very earliest days of the
Christian era.</p>

<p>The importance of Chinon's rôle in history
and the beauty of its situation have inspired
many writers to sing its praises.</p>


<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i6">"... Chinon<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Petite ville, grand renom<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Assise sur pierre ancienne<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Au haute le bois, au bas la Vienne."<br /></span>
</div></div>


<p>The disposition of the town is most picturesque.
The winding streets and stairways
are "foreign;" like Italy, if you will, or some
of the steps to be seen in the towns bordering
upon the Adriatic. At all events, Chinon is not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">253</a></span>
exactly like any other town in France, either
with respect to its layout or its distinct features,
and it is not at all like what one commonly
supposes to be characteristic of the
French.</p>

<div class="figright">

<div class="caption"><a href="images/illus327.jpg"><i>The Roof-tops of Chinon</i></a></div>
</div>



<p>Dungeons of mediæval châteaux are here
turned into dwellings and wine-cellars, and
have the advantage, for both uses, of being cool
in summer and warm in winter.</p>

<p>Already, in the year 371, Chinon's population
was so considerable that St. Martin, newly
elected Bishop of Tours, longed to preach
Christianity to its people, who were still idolators.
Some years afterward St. Mesme or
Maxime, fleeing from the barbarians of the
north, came to Chinon, and soon surrounded
himself with many adherents of the faith, and
in the year 402 consecrated the original foundation
of the church which now bears his name.</p>

<p>Clovis made Chinon one of the strongest fortresses
of his kingdom, and in the tenth century
it came into the possession of the Comtes
de Touraine. Later, in 1044, Thibaut III.
ceded it to Geoffroy Martel. The Plantagenets
frequently sojourned at Chinon, becoming
its masters in the twelfth century, from which
time it was held by the Kings of France up to
Louis XI.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">254</a></span></p>

<p>The most picturesque event of Chinon's history
took place in 1428, when Charles VII. here
assembled the States General, and Jeanne
d'Arc prevailed upon him to march forthwith
upon Orleans, then besieged by the English.</p>

<p>Memories of Charles VII., of Jeanne d'Arc,
and of François Rabelais are inextricably
mixed in the guide-book accounts of Chinon;
but their respective histories are not so involved
as would appear. There is some doubt
as to whether the Pantagruelist was actually
born at Chinon or in the suburbs, therefore
there is no "<i>maison natale</i>" before which
literary pilgrims may make their devotions.
All this is a great pity, for Rabelais excites in
the minds of most people a greater curiosity
than perhaps any other mediæval man of letters
that the world has known.</p>

<p>Though one cannot feast his eye upon the
spot of Rabelais's birth, historians agree that
it took place at Chinon in 1483. Much is known
of the "Curé de Chinon;" but, in spite of his
rank as the first of the mediæval satirists, his
was not a wide-spread popularity, nor can one
speak very highly of his appearance as a type
of the Tourangeau of his time. His portraits
make him appear a most supercilious character,
and doubtless he was. He certainly was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">256</a></span>
not an Adonis, nor had he the head of a god
or the cleverness of a court gallant. Indeed
there has been a tendency of late to represent
him as a buffoon, a trait wholly foreign to
his real character.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/illus331_small.jpg" alt="Rabelais" title="Rabelais" />
<div class="caption"><a href="images/illus331.jpg"><i>Rabelais</i></a></div>
</div>



<p>As for Charles VII. and Jeanne d'Arc, Chinon
was simply the meeting-place between the
inspired maid and her sovereign, when she
urged him to put himself at the head of his
troops and march upon Orleans.</p>

<p>Chinon is of the sunny south; here the
grapes ripen early and cling affectionately, not
only to the hillsides, but to the very house-walls
themselves.</p>

<p>Chinon's attractions consist of fragments of
three castles, dating from feudal times; of
three churches, of more than ordinary interest
and picturesqueness; and many old timbered
and gabled houses; nor should one forget the
Hôtel de France, itself a reminder of other
days, with its vine-covered courtyard and tinkling
bells hanging beneath its gallery, for all
the world like the sort of thing one sees upon
the stage.</p>

<p>There is not much else about the hotel that
is of interest except its very ancient-looking
high-posted beds and its waxed tiled floors,
worn into smooth ruts by the feet of countless<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">257</a></span>
thousands and by countless polishings with wax.
It is curious how a waxed tiled floor strikes
one as being something altogether superior to
one of wood. Though harder in substance, it is
infinitely pleasanter to the feet, and warm and
mellow, as a floor should be; moreover it seems
to have the faculty of unconsciously keeping
itself clean.</p>

<p><i>The Château de Chinon</i>, as it is commonly
called, differs greatly from the usual Loire
château; indeed it is quite another variety altogether,
and more like what we know elsewhere
as a castle; or, rather it is three castles,
for each, so far as its remains are concerned,
is distinct and separate.</p>

<p>The Château de St. Georges is the most ancient
and is an enlargement by Henry Plantagenet&mdash;whom
a Frenchman has called "the
King Lear of his race"&mdash;of a still more ancient
fortress.</p>

<p>The Château du Milieu is built upon the ruins
of the <i>castrum romanum</i>, vestiges of which are
yet visible. It dates from the eleventh, twelfth,
and thirteenth centuries, and was restored
under Charles VI., Charles VII., and Louis XI.</p>

<p>One enters through the curious Tour de
l'Horloge, to which access is given by a modern
bridge, as it was in other days by an ancient<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">258</a></span>
drawbridge which covered the old-time moat.
The Grand Logis, the royal habitation of the
twelfth to fifteenth centuries, is to the right,
overlooking the town. Here died Henry II. of
England (1189) and here lived Charles VII.
and Louis XI. It was in the Grand Salle of this
château that Jeanne d'Arc was first presented
to her sovereign (March 8, 1429). From the
hour of this auspicious meeting until the hour
of the departure for Orleans she herself lived in
the tower of the Château de Coudray, a little
farther beyond, under guard of Guillaume
Bélier.</p>

<p>The meeting between the king and the
"Maid" is described by an old historian of
Touraine as follows: "The inhabitants of
Chinon received her with enthusiasm, the purpose
of her mission having already preceded
her.... She appeared at court as '<i>une
pauvre petite bergerette</i>' and was received in
the Grande Salle, lighted by fifty torches and
containing three hundred persons." (This
statement would seem to point to the fact that
it was not the <i>salle</i> which is shown to-day; it
certainly could not be made to hold three hundred
people unless they stood on each other's
shoulders!) "The seigneurs were all clad in
magnificent robes, but the king, on the contrary,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">259</a></span>
was dressed most simply. The 'Maid,' endowed
with a spirit and sagacity superior to
her education, advanced without hesitation.
'<i>Dieu vous donne bonne vie, gentil roi</i>,' said
she...."</p>

<div class="figright">
<img src="images/illus335_small.jpg" alt="Château de Chinon" title="Château de Chinon" />
<div class="caption"><a href="images/illus335.jpg"><i>Château de Chinon</i></a></div>
</div>



<p>The Grand Logis is flanked by a square tower
which is separated from the Château de Coudray
and the Tour de Boissy by a moat. In the
magnificent Tour de Boissy was the ancient
Salle des Gardes, while above was a battlemented
gallery which gave an outlook over the
surrounding country. This watch-tower assured
absolute safety from surprise to any
monarch who might have wished to study the
situation for himself.</p>

<p>The Tour du Moulin is another of the defences,
more elegant, if possible, than the Tour
de Boissy. It is taller and less rotund; the
French say it is "svelt," and that describes
it as well as anything. It also fits into the landscape
in a manner which no other mediæval
donjon of France does, unless it be that of Château
Gaillard, in Normandy.</p>

<p>The primitive Château de Coudray was built
by Thibaut-le-Tricheur in 954, and its bastion
and sustaining walls are still in evidence.</p>

<p>The Vienne, which runs by Chinon to join the
Loire above Saumur, is, in many respects, a re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">260</a></span>markable
river, although just here there is
nothing very remarkable about it. It is, however,
delightfully picturesque, as it washes the
tree-lined quays which form Chinon's river-front
for a distance of upward of two kilometres.
In general the waterway reminds one
of something between a great traffic-bearing
river and a mere pleasant stream.</p>

<p>The bridge between Chinon and its faubourg
is typical of the art of bridge-building, at which,
in mediæval times, the French were excelled by
no other nation. To-day, in company with the
Americans, they build iron and steel abominations
which are eyesores which no amount of
utility will ever induce one to really admire.
Not so the French bridges of mediæval times,
of the type of those at Blois on the Loire; at
Chinon on the Vienne; at Avignon on the
Rhône; or at Cahors on the Lot.</p>

<p>If Rabelais had not rendered popular Chinon
and the Chinonais the public would have yet to
learn of this delightful <i>pays</i>, in spite of that
famous first meeting between Charles VII. and
Jeanne d'Arc.</p>

<p>If the modern founders of "garden-cities"
would only go as far back as the time of Richelieu
they would find a good example to follow
in the little Touraine town, the <i>chef-lieu</i> of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">261</a></span>
Commune, which bears the name of Richelieu.
When Armand du Plessis first became the
seigneur of this "<i>little land</i>" he resolutely set
about to make of the property a town which
should dignify his name. Accordingly he built,
at his own expense, after the plans of Lemercier,
"a city, regular, vast, and luxurious."
At the same time the cardinal-minister replaced
the paternal manor with a château elaborately
and prodigally royal.</p>

<p>Richelieu was a sort of "petit Versailles,"
which was to be to Chinon what the real Versailles
was to the capital.</p>

<p>To-day, as in other days, it is a "<i>ville vaste,
régulière et luxueuse</i>," but it is unfinished. One
great street only has been completed on its
original lines, and it is exactly 450 metres long.
Originally the town was to have the dimensions
of but six hundred by four hundred metres;
modest enough in size, but of the greatest luxury.
The cardinal had no desire to make it
more grand, but even what he had planned was
not to be. Its one great street is bordered with
imposing buildings, but their tenants to-day
have not the least resemblance to the courtiers
of the cardinal who formerly occupied them.</p>

<p>Richelieu disappeared in the course of time,
and work on his hobby stopped, or at least<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">262</a></span>
changed radically in its plan. Secondary
streets were laid out, of less grandeur, and
peopled with houses without character, low in
stature, and unimposing. The plan of a <i>ville
seigneuriale</i> gave way to a <i>ville de labeur</i>.
Other habitations grew up until to-day twenty-five
hundred souls find their living on the spot
where once was intended to be only a life of
luxury.</p>

<p>Of the monuments with which Richelieu
would have ornamented his town there remains
a curious market-hall and a church in the pure
Jesuitic style of architecture, lacking nothing
of pretence and grandeur.</p>

<p>Not much can be said for the vast Église
Notre Dame de Richelieu, a heavy Italian structure,
built from the plans of Lemercier. However
satisfying and beautiful the style may be
in Italy, it is manifestly, in all great works of
church-building in the north, unsuitable and uncouth.</p>

<p>There was also a château as well, a great
Mansart affair with an overpowering dome.
Practically this remains to-day, but, like all
else in the town, it is but a promise of greater
things which were expected to materialize, but
never did.</p>

<p>At the bottom of a little valley, in a fertile<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">263</a></span>
plain, lies Fontevrault, or what there is left of
it, for the old abbey is now nothing more than
a matter-of-fact "<i>maison de détention</i>" for
criminals. The abbey of yesterday is the
prison of to-day.</p>

<p>Fontevrault is an enigma; it is, furthermore,
what the French themselves call a "<i>triste et
maussade bourg</i>." Its former magnificent
abbey was one of the few shrines of its class
which was respected by the Revolution, but
now it has become a prison which shelters
something like a thousand unfortunates.</p>

<p>For centuries the old abbey had royal princesses
for abbesses and was one of the most
celebrated religious houses in all France. It
is a sad degeneration that has befallen this
famous establishment.</p>

<p>In the eleventh century an illustrious man of
God, a Breton priest, named Robert d'Arbrissel,
outlined the foundation of the abbey
and gathered together a community of monks.
He died in the midst of his labours, in 1117, and
was succeeded by the Abbess Petronille de
Chemille.</p>

<p>For nearly six hundred years the abbey&mdash;which
comprised a convent for men and another
for women&mdash;grew and prospered, directed,
not infrequently, by an abbess of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">264</a></span>
blood royal. It has been claimed that, as a religious
establishment for men and women, ruled
over by a woman, the abbey of Fontevrault was
unique in Christendom.</p>

<p>It is an ample structure with a church tower
of bistre which forms a most pleasing note
of colour in the landscape. The basilica was
begun in 1101, and consecrated by Pope Calixtus
II. in 1119. Its interior showed a deep
vaulting, with graceful and hardy arches supported
by massive columns with quaint and
curiously sculptured capitals.</p>

<p>The twelfth-century cloister was indeed a
masterwork among those examples, all too
rare, existing to-day. Its arcade is severely
elegant and was rebuilt by the Abbess Renée de
Bourbon, sister of François I., after the best
of decorative Renaissance of that day. The
chapter-house, now used by the director of the
prison, has in a remarkable manner retained
the mural frescoes of a former day. There are
depicted a series of groups of mystical and real
personages in a most curious fashion. The refectory
is still much in its primitive state,
though put to other uses to-day. Its tribune,
where the lectrice entertained the sisters during
their repasts, is, however, still in its place.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265"></a></span></p>

<p>The curious, bizarre, kilnlike pyramid,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">266</a></span>
known as the Tour d'Evrault, has ever been an
enigma to the archæologist and antiquarian.
Doubtless it formed the kitchens of the establishment,
for it looks like nothing else that
might have belonged to a great abbey. It has
a counterpart at the Abbey of Marmoutier near
Tours, and of St. Trinité at Vendôme; from
which fact there would seem to be little doubt
as to its real use, although it looks more like
a blast furnace or a distillery chimney.</p>

<p>This curious pyramidal structure is like the
collegiate church of St. Ours at Loches, one of
those bizarre edifices which defy any special
architectural classification. At Fontevrault the
architect played with his art when he let all the
light in this curious "<i>tour</i>" enter by the roof.
At the extreme apex of the cone he placed a
lantern from which the light of day filtered
down the slope of the vaulting in a weird and
tomblike manner. It is a most surprising
effect, but one that is wholly lost to-day, since
the Tour d'Evrault has been turned into the
kitchen for the "<i>maison de détention</i>" of
which it forms a part.</p>

<p>The nave of the church of the old abbey of
Fontevrault has been cut in two and a part is
now used as the dormitory of the prison, but
the choir, the transepts, and the towers remain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">267</a></span>
to suggest the simple and beautiful style of
their age.</p>

<p>In the transepts, behind an iron grille, are
buried Henry II., King of England and Count
of Anjou, Éléanore of Guienne, Richard C&#339;ur
de Lion, and Isabeau of Angoulême, wife of
Jean-sans-Terre. Four polychromatic statues,
one in wood, the others in stone, lying at length,
represent these four personages so great in
English history, and make of Fontevrault a
shrine for pilgrims which ought to be far less
ignored than it is. The cemetery of kings has
been shockingly cared for, and the ludicrous
kaleidoscopic decorations of the statues which
surmount the royal tombs are nothing less than
a sacrilege. It is needless to say they are comparatively
modern.</p>

<p>At Bourgueil, near Fontevrault, are gathered
great crops of <i>réglisse</i>, or licorice. It differs
somewhat in appearance from the licorice
roots of one's childhood, but the same qualities
exist in it as in the product of Spain or the
Levant, whence indeed most of the commercial
licorice does come. It is as profitable an industry
in this part of France as is the saffron
crop of the Gâtinais, and whoever imported the
first roots was a benefactor. At the juncture
of the Vienne and the Loire are two tiny towns<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">268</a></span>
which are noted for two widely different reasons.</p>

<p>These two towns are Montsoreau and
Candes, the former noted for the memory of
that bloodthirsty woman who gave a plot to
Dumas (and some real facts of history besides),
and the other noted for its prunes,
Candes being the chief centre of the industry
which produces the <i>pruneaux de Tours</i>.</p>

<p>Descending the Vienne from Chinon, one first
comes to Candes, which dominates the confluence
of the Vienne with the Loire from its
imposing position on the top of a hill.</p>

<p>Candes was in other times surrounded by
a protecting wall, and there are to-day remains
of a château which had formerly given shelter
to Charles VII. and Louis XI. It has, moreover,
a twelfth-century church built upon the
site of the cell in which died St. Martin in the
fourth century. The native of the surrounding
country cares nothing for churches or châteaux,
but assumes that the prune industry of
Candes is the one thing of interest to the visitor.</p>

<p>Be this as it may, it is indeed a matter of
considerable importance to all within a dozen
kilometres of the little town. All through the
region round about Candes one meets with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">269</a></span>
fruit-pickers, with their great baskets laden
with prunes, pears, and apples, to be sent ultimately
to the great ovens to be desiccated and
dried. Fifty years ago, you will be told, the
cultivators attended to the curing process themselves,
but now it is in the hands of the middle-man.</p>

<p>At Montsoreau much the same economic conditions
exist as at Candes, but there is vastly
more of historic lore hanging about the town.
In the fourteenth century, after a shifting career
the fief passed to the Vicomtes de Châteaudun;
then, in the century following, to the
Chabots and the family of Chambes, of which
Jean IV., prominent in the massacre of St.
Bartholomew's night, was a member. It was
he who assassinated the gallant Bussy d'Amboise
at the near-by Château of Coutancière
(at Brain-sur-Allonnes), who had made a rendezvous
with his wife, since become famous in
the pages of Dumas and of history as "La
Dame de Montsoreau."</p>

<p>To-day the old bourg is practically non-existent,
and there is a smugness of prosperity
which considerably discounts the former charm
that it once must have had. But for all that,
there is enough left to enable one to picture<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">270</a></span>
what the life here under the Renaissance must
have been.</p>

<p>The parish church&mdash;that of the ancient Paroisse
de Retz&mdash;still exists, though in ruins,
and there are very substantial remains of an
old priory, an old-time dependency of the Abbey
of St. Florent, now converted into a farm.</p>

<p>Beside the highroad is the fifteenth-century
château. It has a double façade, one side of
which is ornamented with a series of <i>mâchicoulis</i>,
great high window-openings, and flanking
towers; and, in spite of its generally frowning
aspect, looks distinctly livable even to-day.</p>

<p>The ornamental façade of the courtyard is
somewhat crumbled but still elegant, and has
incorporated within its walls a most ravishing
Renaissance turret, smothered in exquisite
<i>moulures</i> and <i>arabesques</i>. On the terminal gallery
and on the panels which break up the flatness
of this inner façade are a series of allegorical
bas-reliefs, representing monkeys, surmounted
with the inscription, "<i>Il le Feray</i>."</p>

<p>The interior of this fine edifice is entirely
remodelled, and has nothing of its former fitments,
furnishings, or decorations.</p>

<p>Near Port Boulet, almost opposite Candes,
is the great farm of a certain M. Cail. Communication
is had with the Orleans railway by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">271</a></span>
means of a traction engine, which draws its
own broad-wheeled wagons on the regular highway
between the <i>gare d'hommes</i> and the tall-chimneyed
manor or château which forms the
residence of this enterprising agriculturist.</p>

<p>The property consists of nearly two thousand
acres, of which at least twelve hundred are
under the process of intensive cultivation, and
is divided into ten distinct farms, having each
an overseer charged directly with the control
of his part of the domain. These farms are
wonderfully well kept, with sanded roadways
like the courtyard of a château. There are
no trees in the cultivated parts, and the great
grain-fields are as the western prairies.</p>

<p>The estate bears the generic name of "La
Briche." On one side it is bordered by the
railroad for a distance of nearly forty kilometres,
and it gives to that same railway an
annual freight traffic of two thousand tons of
merchandise, which would be considerably more
if all the cattle and sheep sent to other markets
were transported by rail.</p>

<p>As might be expected, this domain of "La
Briche" has given to the neighbouring farmers
a lesson and an example, and little by little its
influence has resulted in an increased activity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">272</a></span>
among the neighbouring landholders, who formerly
gave themselves over to "<i>la chasse</i>,"
and left the conduct of their farms to incompetent
and more or less ignorant hirelings.

<h2>CHAPTER XIII.<span class="pagenum"><a href="#Contents">To ToC</a></span></h2>

<h4>ANJOU AND BRETAGNE</h4>


<p>As one crosses the borderland from Touraine
into Anjou, the whole aspect of things changes.
It is as if one went from the era of the Renaissance
back again into the days of the Gothic,
not only in respect to architecture, but history
and many of the conditions of every-day life as
well.</p>

<p>Most of the characteristics of Anjou are
without their like elsewhere, and opulent Anjou
of ancient France has to-day a departmental
etiquette in many things quite different from
that of other sections.</p>

<p>A magnificent agricultural province, it has
been further enriched by liberal proprietors; a
land of aristocracy and the church, it has ever
been to the fore in political and ecclesiastical
matters; and to-day the spirit of industry and
progress are nowhere more manifest than here
in the ancient province of Anjou.</p>

<p>The Loire itself changes its complexion but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">274</a></span>
little, and its entrance into Saumur, like its
entrance into Tours, is made between banks
that are tinged with the rainbow colours of the
growing vine. What hills there are near by
are burrowed, as swallows burrow in a cliff,
by the workers of the vineyards, who make in
the rock homes similar to those below Saumur,
in the Vallée du Vendomois, and at Cinq-Mars
near Tours.</p>

<p>Anjou has a marked style in architecture,
known as Angevin, which few have properly
placed in the gamut of architectural styles
which run from the Byzantine to the Renaissance.</p>

<p>The Romanesque was being supplanted
everywhere when the Angevin style came into
being, as a compromise between the heavy,
flat-roofed style of the south and the pointed
sky-piercing gables of the north. All Europe
was attempting to shake off the Romanesque
influence, which had lasted until the twelfth
century. Germany alone clung to the pure
style, and, it is generally thought, improved
it. The Angevin builders developed a species
that was on the borderland between the Romanesque
and the Gothic, though not by any means
a mere transition type.</p>

<p>The chief cities of Anjou are not very great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">275</a></span>
or numerous, Angers itself containing but
slightly over fifty thousand souls. Cholet, of
thirteen thousand inhabitants, is an important
cloth-manufacturing centre, while Saumur carries
on a great wine trade and was formerly
the capital of a "<i>petit gouvernement</i>" of its
own, and, like many other cities and towns of
this and neighbouring provinces, was the scene
of great strife during the wars of the Vendée.</p>

<p>In ancient times the <i>Andecavi</i>, as the old
peoples of the province were known, shared
with the <i>Turonii</i> of Touraine the honour of
being the foremost peoples of western Gaul,
though each had special characteristics peculiarly
their own, as indeed they have to-day.</p>

<p>After one passes the junction of the Cher,
the Indre, and the Vienne, he notices no great
change in the conduct of the Loire itself. It
still flows in and out among the banks of sand
and those little round pebbles known all along
its course, nonchalantly and slowly, though now
and then one fancies that he notes a greater
eddy or current than he had observed before.
At Saumur it is still more impressed upon one,
while at the Ponts de Cé&mdash;a great strategic
spot in days gone by&mdash;there is evidence that
at one time or another the Loire must be a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">276</a></span>
raging torrent; and such it does become periodically,
only travellers never seem to see it
when it is in this condition.</p>

<p>When Candes and Montsoreau are passed
and one comes under the frowning walls of
Saumur's grim citadel, a sort of provincial
Bastille in its awesomeness, he realizes for the
first time that there is, somewhere below, an
outlet to the sea. He cannot smell the salt-laden
breezes at this great distance, but the
general appearance of things gives that impression.</p>

<p>From Tours to Saumur by the right bank of
the Loire&mdash;one of the most superb stretches
of automobile roadway in the world&mdash;lay the
road of which Madame de Sévigné wrote in
"Lettre CCXXIV." (to her mother), which
begins: "<i>Nous arrivons ici, nous avons quitté
Tours ce matin.</i>" It was a good day's journey
for those times, whether by <i>malle-post</i> or
the private conveyance which, likely enough,
Madame de Sévigné used at the time (1630).
To-day it is a mere morsel to the hungry road-devouring
maw of a twentieth-century automobile.
It's almost worth the labour of making
the journey on foot to know the charms of
this delightful river-bank bordered with historic
shrines almost without number, and peo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">277</a></span>pled
by a class of peasants as picturesque and
gay as the Neapolitan of romance.</p>

<div class="figright">
<img src="images/illus355_small.jpg" alt="Château de Saumur" title="Château de Saumur" />
<div class="caption"><a href="images/illus355.jpg"><i>Château de Saumur</i></a></div>
</div>

<p>"<i>Saumur est, ma foi! une jolie ville</i>," said
a traveller one day at a <i>table d'hôte</i> at Tours.
And so indeed it is. Its quays and its squares
lend an air of gaiety to its proud old <i>hôtel de
ville</i> and its grim château. Old habitations,
commodious modern houses, frowning machicolations,
church spires, grand hotels, innumerable
cafés, and much military, all combine
in a blend of fascinating interest that one usually
finds only in a great metropolis.</p>

<p>The chief attraction is unquestionably the
old château. To-day it stands, as it has always
stood, high above the Quai de Limoges, with
scarce a scar on its hardy walls and never a
crumbling stone on its parapet.</p>

<p>The great structure was begun in the eleventh
century, replacing an earlier monument
known as the Tour du Tronc. It was completed
in the century following and rebuilt or
remodelled in the sixteenth. Outside of its
impressive exterior there is little of interest
to remind one of another day.</p>

<p>To literary pilgrims Saumur suggests the
homestead of the father of Eugenie Grandet,
and the <i>bon-vivant</i> reveres it for its soft pleasant
wines. Others worship it for its wonders<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">278</a></span>
of architecture, and yet others fall in love with
it because of its altogether delightful situation.</p>

<p>Below Saumur are the cliff-dwellers, who
burrow high in the chalk cliff and stow themselves
away from light and damp like bottles
of old wine. The custom is old and not indigenous
to France, but here it is sufficiently in
evidence to be remarked by even the traveller
by train. Here, too, one sees the most remarkable
of all the <i>coiffes</i> which are worn by any
of the women along the Loire. This Angevin
variety, like Angevin architecture, is like none
of its neighbours north, east, south, or west.</p>

<p>Students of history will revere Saumur for
something more than its artistic aspect or its
wines, for it was a favourite residence of the
Angevin princes and the English kings, as well
as being the capital of the <i>pape des Huguenots</i>.</p>

<p>While Nantes is the real metropolis of the
Loire, and Angers is singularly up-to-date
and well laid out, neither of these fine cities
have a great thoroughfare to compare with the
broad, straight street of Saumur, which leads
from the Gare d'Orleans on the left bank and
crosses the two bridges which span the branches
of the Loire, to say nothing of the island between,
and finally merges into the great national
highway which runs south into Poitou.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">279</a></span></p>

<p>Fine houses, many, if not most of them, dating
from centuries ago, line the principal
streets of the town, which, when one has actually
entered its confines, presents the appearance
of being too vast and ample for its population.
And, in truth, so it really is. Its population
barely reaches fifteen thousand souls,
whereas it would seem to have the grandeur
and appointments of a city of a hundred thousand.
The revocation of the Edict of Nantes
cut its inhabitants down to the extent of twenty
or twenty-five thousand, and it has never recovered
from the blow.</p>

<p>In the neighbourhood of Saumur, for a considerable
distance up and down the Loire, the
hills are excavated into dwelling-houses and
wine-caves, producing a most curious aspect.
One continuous line of these cliff villages&mdash;like
nothing so much as the habitations of the
cliff-dwelling Indians of America&mdash;extends
from the juncture of the Vienne with the Loire
nearly up to the Ponts de Cé.</p>

<p>The most curious effect of it all is the multitude
of openings of doorways and windows and
the uprising of chimney-pots through the chalk
and turf which form the roof-tops of these
settlements.</p>

<p>In many of these caves are prepared the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">280</a></span>
famous <i>vin mousseux</i> of Saumur, of which
the greater part is sold as champagne to an
unsuspecting and indifferent public, not by the
growers or makers, but by unscrupulous middlemen.</p>

<p>Saumur, like Angers, is fortunate in its climate,
to which is due a great part of the prosperity
of the town, for the "Rome of the
Huguenots" is more prosperous&mdash;and who
shall not say more content?&mdash;than it ever
was in the days of religious or feudal warfare.</p>

<p>Near Saumur is one shrine neglected by English
pilgrims which might well be included in
their itineraries. In the Château de Moraines
at Dampierre died Margaret of Anjou and Lancaster,
Queen of England, as one reads on a
tablet erected at the gateway of this dainty
"<i>petit castel à tour et creneaux</i>."</p>


<div class="box2">Manoir de la Vignole-Souzay autrefois Dampierre<br/>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">281</a></span>The Salvus Murus of the ancients became
the Saumur of to-day in the year 948, when the
monk Absalom built a monastery here and surrounded
it with a protecting wall. Up to the
thirteenth century the city belonged to the
"Angevin kings of Angleterre," as the French
historians proudly claim them.</p>

<p>The city passed finally to the Kings of
France, and to them remained constantly faithful.
Under Henri IV. the city was governed
by Duplessis-Mornay, the "<i>pape des Huguenots</i>,"
becoming practically the metropolis of
Protestantism. Up to this time the chief architectural
monument was the château, which was
commenced in the eleventh century and which
through the next five centuries had been aggrandized
and rebuilt into its present shape.</p>

<p>The church of Notre Dame de Nantilly dates
from the twelfth century and was frequently
visited by Louis XI. The oratory formerly
made use of by this monarch to-day contains
the baptismal fonts. One of the columns of
the nave has graven upon it the epitaph composed
by King René of Anjou for his foster-mother,
Dame Thiephanie. Throughout, the
church is beautifully decorated.</p>

<p>The Hôtel de Ville may well be called the
chief artistic treasure of Saumur, as the chât<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">282</a></span>teau
is its chief historical monument. It is a
delightful <i>ensemble</i> of the best of late Gothic,
dating from the sixteenth century, flanked on
its façade by turrets crowned with <i>mâchicoulis</i>,
and lighted by a series of elegant windows
<i>à croisillons</i>. Above all is a gracious campanile,
in its way as fine as the belfry of Bruges,
to which, from a really artistic standpoint,
rhapsodists have given rather more than its
due.</p>

<p>The interior is as elaborate and pleasing as
is the outside. In the Salle des Mariages and
Salle du Conseil are fine fifteenth-century chimneypieces,
such as are only found in their perfection
on the Loire. The library, of something
over twenty thousand volumes, many of
them in manuscript, is formed in great part
from the magnificent collection formerly at the
abbeys of Fontevrault and St. Florent. Doubtless
these old tomes contain a wealth of material
from which some future historian will perhaps
construct a new theory of the universe.
This in truth may not be literally so, but it is
a fact that there is a vast amount of contemporary
historical information, with regard to
the world in general, which is as yet unearthed,
as witness the case of Pompeii alone, where the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">283</a></span>
area of the discoveries forms but a small part
of the entire buried city.</p>

<p>At Saumur numerous prehistoric and <i>gallo-romain</i>
remains are continually being added
to the museum, which is also in the Hôtel de
Ville. A recent acquisition&mdash;discovered in a
neighbouring vineyard&mdash;is a Roman "<i>trompette</i>,"
as it is designated, and a more or less
complete outfit of tools, obviously those of a
carpenter.</p>

<p>The notorious Madame de Montespan&mdash;"the
illustrious penitent," though the former
description answers better&mdash;stopped here, in
a house adjoining the Church of St. John, to-day
a <i>maison de retrait</i>, on her way to visit
her sister, the abbess, at Fontevrault.</p>

<p>From Saumur to Angers the Loire passes
an almost continuous series of historical guide-posts,
some in ruins, but many more as proudly
environed as ever.</p>

<p>At Treves-Cunault is a dignified Romanesque
church which would add to the fame of a more
popular and better known town. It is not a
grand structure, but it is perfect of its kind,
with its crenelated façade and its sturdy arcaded
towers curiously placed midway on the
north wall.</p>

<p>Here one first becomes acquainted with <i>men<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">284</a></span>hirs</i>
and <i>dolmens</i>, examples of which are to
be found in the neighbourhood, not so remarkable
as those of Brittany, but still of the same
family.</p>

<p>The Ponts de Cé follow next, still in the midst
of vine-land, and finally appear the twin spires
of Angers's unique Cathedral of St. Maurice.
Here one realizes, if not before, that he is in
Anjou; no more is the atmosphere transparent
as in Touraine, but something of the grime
of the commercial struggle for life is over all.</p>

<p>Here the Maine joins the Loire, at a little
village called La Pointe: "the Charenton of
Angers," it was called by a Paris-loving boulevardier
who once wandered afield.</p>

<p>Much has been written, and much might yet
be written, about the famous Ponts de Cé, which
span the Loire and its branches for a distance
considerably over three kilometres. This ancient
bridge or bridges (which, with that at
Blois, were at one time, the only bridges across
the Loire below Orleans) formerly consisted
of 109 arches, but the reconstruction of the
mid-nineteenth century reduced these to a bare
score.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/illus365_small.jpg" alt="The Ponts de Cé" title="The Ponts de Cé" />
<div class="caption"><a href="images/illus365.jpg"><i>The Ponts de Cé</i></a></div>
</div>



<p>As a vantage-point in warfare the Ponts de
Cé were ever in contention, the Gauls, the Romans,
the Franks, the Normans, and the Eng<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">285</a></span>lish
successively taking possession and defending
them against their opponents. The Ponts
de Cé is a weirdly strange and historic town
which has lost none of its importance in a later
day, though the famous <i>ponts</i> are now remade,
and their antique arches replaced by more solid,
if less picturesque piers and piling. They span
the shallow flow of the Loire water for three-quarters
of a league and produce a homogeneous
effect of antiquity, coupled with the city's
three churches and its château overlooking the
fortified isle in mid-river, which looks as though
it had not changed since the days when Marie
de Medici looked upon it, as recalled by the
great Rubens painting in the Louvre. Since
the beginning of the history of these parts, battles
almost without number have taken place
here, as was natural on a spot so strategically
important.</p>

<p>There is a tale of the Vendean wars, connected
with the "Roche-de-Murs" at the Ponts
de Cé, to the effect that a battalion, left here
to guard any attack from across the river, was
captured by the Vendeans. Many of the
"<i>Bleus</i>" refused to surrender, and threw
themselves into the river beneath their feet.
Among these was the wife of an officer, to
whom the Vendeans offered life if she surren<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">286</a></span>dered.
This was refused, and precipitately,
with her child, she threw herself into the flood
beneath.</p>

<p>On the largest isle, that lying between the
Louet and the Loire, is one vast garden or
orchard of cherry-trees, which produce a peculiarly
juicy cherry from which large quantities
of <i>guignolet</i>, a sort of "cherry brandy," is
made. The Angevins will tell you that this was
a well-known refreshment in the middle ages,
and was first made by one of those monkish
orders who were so successful in concocting the
subtle liquors of the commerce of to-day.</p>

<p>It is with real regret that one parts from
the Ponts de Cé, with La Fontaine's couplet on
his lips:</p>


<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0_5">"... Ce n'est pas petite gloire<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Que d'être pont sur la Loire."<br /></span>
</div></div>


<p>Some one has said that the provinces find
nothing to envy in Paris as far as the transformation
of their cities is concerned. This, to
a certain extent, is so, not only in respect to
the modernizing of such grand cities as Lyons,
Marseilles, or Lille, but in respect to such
smaller cities as Nantes and Angers, where the
improvements, if not on so magnificent a scale,
are at least as momentous to their immediate
environment.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">287</a></span></p>

<p>For the most part these second and third
class cities are to-day transformed in exceedingly
good taste, and, though many a noble
monument has in the past been sacrificed, to-day
the authorities are proceeding more carefully.</p>

<p>Angers, in spite of its overpowering château
and its unique cathedral, is of a modernity and
luxuriousness in its present-day aspect which
is all the more remarkable because of the contrast.
Formerly the Angevin capital, from the
days of King John up to a much later time
Angers had the reputation of being a town
"<i>plus sombre et plus maussade</i>" than any
other in the French provinces. In Shakespeare's
"King John" one reads of "black
Angers," and so indeed is its aspect to-day,
for its roof-tops are of slate, while many of the
houses are built of that material entirely. In
the olden time many of its streets were cut in
the slaty rock, leaving its sombre surface bare
to the light of day. One sees evidences of all
this in the massive walls of the great black-banded
castle of Angers, and, altogether, this
magpie colouring is one of the chief characteristics
of this grandly historic town.</p>

<p>Both the new and the old town sit proudly on
a height crowned by the two slim spires of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">288</a></span>
cathedral. In front, the gentle curves of the
river Maine enfold the old houses at the base
of the hillside and lap the very walls of the
grim fortress-château itself, or did in the days
when the Counts of Anjou held sway, though
to-day the river has somewhat receded.</p>

<p>Beyond the ancient ramparts, up the hill,
have been erected the "<i>quartiers neufs</i>," with
houses all admirably planned and laid out, with
gardens forming a veritable girdle, as did the
retaining walls of other days which surrounded
the old château and its faubourg. To-day
Angers shares with Nantes the title of metropolis
of the west, and the Loire flows on its ample
way between the two in a far more imposing
manner than elsewhere in its course from
source to sea.</p>

<p>Angers does not lie exactly at the juncture
of the Maine and Loire, but a little way above,
but it has always been considered as one of
the chief Loire cities; and probably many of
its visitors do not realize that it is not on the
Loire itself.</p>

<p>The marvellous fairy-book château of Angers,
with its fourteen black-striped towers, is
just as it was when built by St. Louis, save that
its chess-board towers lack, in most cases, their
coiffes, and all vestiges have disappeared of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">289</a></span>
the <i>charpente</i> which formerly topped them
off.</p>

<div class="figright">
<img src="images/illus371_small.jpg" alt="Château d&#39;Angers" title="Château d&#39;Angers" />
<div class="caption"><a href="images/illus371.jpg"><i>Château d'Angers</i></a></div>
</div>

<p>Beyond the rocky formation of the banks
of the Loire, which crop out below the juncture
of the Maine and the Loire, below Angers, are
Savennières and La Possonière, whence come
the most famous vintages of Anjou, which, to
the wines of these parts, are what Château
Margaux and Château Yquem are to the Bordelais,
and the Clos Vougeot is to the Bourguignons.</p>

<p>The peninsula formed by the Loire and the
Maine at Angers is the richest agricultural
region in all France, the nurseries and the
kitchen-gardens having made the fortune of
this little corner of Anjou.</p>

<p>Angers is the headquarters for nursery-garden
stock for the open air, as Orleans is for
ornamental and woodland trees and shrubs.</p>

<p>The trade in living plants and shrubs has
grown to very great proportions since 1848,
when an agent went out from here on behalf
of the leading house in the trade and visited
America for the purpose of searching out foreign
plants and fruits which could be made to
thrive on French soil.</p>

<p>Both the soil and climate are very favourable
for the cultivation of many hitherto unknown<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">290</a></span>
fruits, the neighbourhood of the sea, which,
not far distant, is tempered by the Gulf Stream,
having given to Anjou a lukewarm humidity
and a temperature of a remarkable equality.</p>

<p>Some of the nurseries of these parts are
enormous establishments, the Maison André
Leroy, for example, covering an extent of some
six hundred acres. A catalogue of one of these
establishments, located in the suburbs of Angers,
enumerates over four hundred species of
pear-trees, six hundred varieties of apple-trees,
one hundred and fifty varieties of plums, four
hundred and seventy-five of grapes, fifteen hundred
of roses, and two hundred and nineteen
of rhododendrons.</p>

<p>Each night, or as often as fifty railway wagons
are loaded, trains are despatched from the
<i>gare</i> at Angers for all parts. When the <i>choux-fleurs</i>
are finished, then come the <i>petits pois</i>,
and then the <i>artichauts</i> and other <i>légumes</i> in
favour with the Paris <i>bon-vivants</i>.</p>

<p>Near Angers is one of those Cæsar's camps
which were spread thickly up and down Gaul
and Britain alike. One reaches it by road from
Angers, and, until it dawns upon one that the
vast triangle, one of whose equilateral sides is
formed by the Loire, another by the Maine,
and the third by a ridge of land stretching be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">291</a></span>tween
the two, covers about fourteen kilometres
square, it seems much like any other neck or
peninsula of land lying between two rivers.
One hundred thousand of the Roman legion
camped here at one time, which is not so very
wonderful until it is recalled that they lived
for months on the resources of this comparatively
restricted area.</p>

<p>Before coming to Nantes, Ancenis and Oudon
should claim the attention of the traveller,
though each is not much more than a typically
interesting small town of France, in spite of
the memories of the past.</p>

<p>Ancenis has an ancient château, remodelled
and added to in the nineteenth century, which
possesses some remarkably important constructive
details, the chief of which are a great
tower-flanked doorway and the <i>corps de logis</i>,
each the work of an Angevin architect, Jean de
Lespine, in the sixteenth century. Within the
walls of this château François II., Duc de Bretagne,
and Louis XI. signed one of the treaties
which finally led up to the union of the Duché
de Bretagne with the Crown of France.</p>

<p>Oudon possesses a fine example of a mediæval
donjon, though it has been restored in our
day.</p>

<p>One does not usually connect Brittany with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">292</a></span>
the Loire except so far as to recollect that
Nantes was a former political and social capital.
As a matter of fact, however, a very considerable
proportion of Brittany belongs to the
Loire country.</p>

<p>Anjou of the counts and kings and Bretagne
of the dukes and duchesses embrace the whole
of the Loire valley below Saumur, although the
river-bed of the Loire formed no actual boundary.
Anjou extended nearly as far to the southward
as it did to the north of the vine-clad
banks, and Bretagne, too, had possession of a
vast tract south of Nantes, known as the Pays
de Retz, which bordered upon the Vendée of
Poitou.</p>

<p>All the world knows, or should know, that
Nantes and St. Nazaire form one of the great
ports of the world, not by any means so great
as New York, London, or Hamburg, nor yet
as great as Antwerp, Bordeaux, or Marseilles,
but still a magnificent port which plays a most
important part with the affairs of France and
the outside world.</p>

<p>Nantes, la Brette, is tranquil and solid, with
the life of the laborious bourgeois always in the
foreground. It is of Bretagne, to which province
it anciently belonged, only so far as it
forms the bridge between the Vendée and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">293</a></span>
old duchy; literally between two opposing feudal
lords and masters, both of whom were hard
to please.</p>

<p>The memoirs of this corner of the province
of Bretagne of other days are strong in such
names as the Duchesse Anne, the monk Abelard,
the redoubtable Clisson, the infamous
Gilles de Retz, the warrior Lanoue, surnamed
"Bras de Fer," and many others whose names
are prominent in history.</p>

<p>"<i>Ventre Saint Gris! les Ducs de Bretagne
n'étaient pas de petits compagnons!</i>" cried
Henri Quatre, as he first gazed upon the Château
de Nantes. At that time, in 1598, this fortress
was defended by seven curtains, six towers,
bastions and caponieres, all protected by
a wide and deep moat, into which poured the
rising tide twice with each round of the clock.</p>

<p>To-day the aspect of this château is no less
formidable than of yore, though it has been
debased and the moat has disappeared to make
room for a roadway and the railroad.</p>

<p>It was in the château of Nantes, the same
whose grim walls still overlook the road by
which one reaches the centre of the town from
the inconveniently placed station, that Mazarin
had Henri de Gondi, Cardinal de Retz and co-adjutor
of the Archbishop of Paris, imprisoned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">294</a></span>
in 1665, because of his offensive partisanship.
Fouquet, too, after his splendid downfall, was
thrown into the donjon here by Louis XIV.</p>

<p>De Gondi recounts in his "Mémoires" how
he took advantage of the inattention of his
guards and finally evaded them by letting himself
over the side of the Bastion de Merc&#339;ur by
means of a rope smuggled into him by his
friends. The feat does not look a very formidable
one to-day, but then, or in any day, it must
have been somewhat of an adventure for a
portly churchman, and the wonder is that it
was performed successfully. At any rate it
reads like a real adventure from the pages of
Dumas, who himself made a considerable use
of Nantes and its château in his historical romances.</p>

<p>Landais, the minister and favourite of François
II. of Bretagne, was arrested here in 1485,
in the very chamber of the prince, who delivered
him up with the remark: "<i>Faites justice,
mais souvenez-vous que vous lui êtes redevable
de votre charge.</i>"</p>

<p>There is no end of historical incident connected
with Nantes's old fortress-château of
mediæval times, and, in one capacity or another,
it has sheltered many names famous in
history, from the Kings of France, from Louis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">295</a></span>
XII. onward, to Madame de Sévigné and the
Duchesse de Berry.</p>

<p>Nantes's Place de la Bouffai (which to lovers
of Dumas will already be an old friend) was
formerly the site of a château contemporary
with that which stands by the waterside. The
Château de Bouffai was built in 990 by Conan,
first Duc de Bretagne, and served as an official
residence to him and many of his successors.</p>

<p>In Nantes's great but imperfect and unfinished
Cathedral of St. Pierre one comes upon
a relic that lives long in the memory of those
who have passed before it: the tomb of François
II., Duc de Bretagne, and Marguerite de
Foix. The cathedral itself is no mean architectural
work, in spite of its imperfections, as
one may judge from the following inscription
graven over the sculptured figure of St. Pierre,
its patron:</p>


<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0_5">"L'an mil quatre cent trente-quatre,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A my-avril sans moult rabattre:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An portail de cette église,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fut la première pierre assise."<br /></span>
</div></div>


<p>Within, the chief attraction is that masterwork
of Michel Colombe, the before-mentioned
tomb, which ranks among the world's art-treasures.
The beauty of the emblematic figures
which flank the tomb proper, the fine chiselling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">296</a></span>
of the recumbent effigies themselves, and the
general <i>ensemble</i> is such that the work is bound
to appeal, whatever may be one's opinion of
Renaissance sculpture in France. The tomb
was brought here from the old Église des
Carmes, which had been pillaged and burned in
the Revolution.</p>

<p>The mausoleum was&mdash;in its old resting-place&mdash;opened
in 1727, and a small, heart-shaped,
gold box was found, supposed to have
contained the heart of the Duchesse Anne. The
coffer was surmounted by a royal crown and
emblazoned with the order of the Cordelière,
but within was found nothing but a scapulary.
On the circlet of the crown was written in
relief:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0_5">"Cueur de vertus orné<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dignement couronné."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>And on the box beneath one read:</p>


<blockquote>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0_5">"En ce petit vaisseau, de fin or pur et munde,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Repose un plus grand cueur que oncque dame eut au monde.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Anne fut le nom d'elle, en France deux fois Royne<br /></span>
<span class="i0">
&nbsp;&nbsp; . &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  . &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; . &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<span class="i0">Et ceste parte terrestre en grand deuil nos demure.<br /></span>
<span class="i6">IX. Janvier M.V.XIII."</span>
</div></div>
</blockquote>


<p>In one respect only has Nantes suffered
through the march of time. Its magnificent
Quai de la Fosse has disappeared, a long façade
which a hundred or more years ago was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">297</a></span>
bordered by the palatial dwellings of the great
ship-owners of the Nantes of a former generation.
The whole, immediately facing the river
where formerly swung many ships at anchor,
has disappeared entirely to make way for the
railway.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<a href="images/illus381.jpg">
<img src="images/illus381_small.jpg" alt="Environs of Nantes" title="Environs of Nantes" />
</a>
</div>

<p>The islands of the Loire opposite Nantes are
an echo of the life of the metropolis itself. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">298</a></span>
Ile Feydeau is monumental, the Ile Gloriette
hustling and nervous with "<i>affaires</i>," and
Prairie-au-Duc busy with industries of all
sorts.</p>

<p>Couëron, below Nantes on the right bank, is
sombre with gray walls surrounding its numberless
factories, and chimney-stacks belching
forth clouds of dense smoke. Behind are great
walls of chalky-white rock crowned with verdure.
Nearly opposite is the little town of Le
Pellerin graciously seated on the river's bank
and marking the lower limit of the Loire Nantaise.</p>

<p>Another hill, belonging to the domain of Bois-Tillac
and La Martinière, where was born
Fouché, the future Duc d'Otranta, comes to
view, and the basin of the Loire enlarges into
the estuary, and all at once one finds himself
in the true "Loire Maritime."</p>

<p>At Martinière is the mouth of the Canal Maritime
à la Loire, which, from Paimb&#339;uf to Le
Pellerin, is used by all craft ascending the
river to Nantes, drawing more than four metres
of water.</p>

<p>At the entrance of the Acheneau is the Canal
de Buzay, which connects that stream with the
more ambitious Loire, and makes of the Lac de
Grand Lieu a public domain, instead of a pri<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">299</a></span>vate
property as claimed by the "marquis"
who holds in terror all who would fish or shoot
over its waters. All this immediate region
formerly belonged to the monks of the ancient
Abbey of Buzay, and it was they who originally
cut the waterway through to the Loire. About
half-way in its length are the ruins of the ancient
monastery, clustered about the tower of its
old church. It is a most romantically sad monument,
and for that very reason its grouping,
on the bank of the busy canal, suggests in a
most impressive manner the passing of all
great works.</p>

<p>The prosperity of Nantes as a deep-sea port
is of long standing, but recent improvements
have increased all this to a hitherto unthought-of
extent. Progress has been continuous,
and now Nantes has become, like Rouen,
a great deep-water port, one of the important
seaports of France, the realization of a hope
ever latent in the breast of the Nantais since
the days and disasters of the Edict and its
revocation.</p>

<p>Below Nantes, in the actual "Loire Maritime,"
the aspect of all things changes and the
green and luxuriant banks give way to sand-dunes
and flat, marshy stretches, as salty as the
sea itself. This gives rise to a very consider<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">300</a></span>able
development of the salt industry which
at Bourg de Batz is the principal, if not the
sole, means of livelihood.</p>

<p>St. Nazaire, the real deep-water port of
Nantes, dates from the fifteenth and sixteenth
centuries, when it was known as Port Nazaire.
It is a progressive and up-to-date seaport of
some thirty-five thousand souls, but it has no
appeal for the tourist unless he be a lover of
great smoky steamships and all the paraphernalia
of longshore life.</p>

<p>Pornichet, a "<i>station de bains de mer
très fréquentée</i>;" Batz, with its salt-works; Le
Croisic, with its curious waterside church, and
the old walled town of Guérande bring one to
the mouth of the Loire. The rest is the billowy
western ocean whose ebb and flow brings
fresh breezes and tides to the great cities of
the estuary and makes possible that prosperity
with which they are so amply endowed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">301</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER XIV.<span class="pagenum"><a href="#Contents">To ToC</a></span></h2>

<h4>SOUTH OF THE LOIRE</h4>


<p>The estuary of the Loire belongs both to
Brittany and to the Vendée, though, as a matter-of-fact,
the southern bank, opposite Nantes,
formed a part of the ancient Pays de Retz, one
of the old seigneuries of Bretagne.</p>

<p>It was Henri de Gondi, Cardinal de Retz,
who was the bitter rival of Mazarin. French
historians have told us that when the regency
under Anne of Austria began, Mazarin, who
had been secretary to the terrible Richelieu,
was just coming into his power. He was a
subtle, insidious Italian, plodding and patient,
but false as a spring-time rainbow. Gondi was
bold, liberal, and independent, a mover of men
and one able to take advantage of any turn of
the wind, a statesman, and a great reformer,&mdash;or
he would have been had he but full power.
It was Cromwell who said that De Retz was the
only man in Europe who saw through his plans.</p>

<p>Gondi had entered the church, but he had no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">302</a></span>
talents for it. His life was free, too free even
for the times, it would appear, for, though he
was ordained cardinal, it was impossible for
him to supplant Mazarin in the good graces
of the court. As he himself had said that he
preferred to be a great leader of a party rather
than a partisan of royalty, he was perhaps not
so very greatly disappointed that he was not
able to supplant the wily Italian successor of
Richelieu in the favour of the queen regent.
Gondi was able to control the parliament, however,
and, for a time, it was unable to carry
through anything against his will. Mazarin
rose to power at last, barricaded the streets
of Paris, and decided to exile Gondi&mdash;as
being the too popular hero of the people.
Gondi knew of the edict, but stuck out to
the last, saying: "To-morrow, I, Henri de
Gondi, before midday, will be master of
Paris." Noon came, and he <i>was</i> master of
Paris, but as he was still Archbishop-Coadjutor
of Paris his hands were tied in more ways
than one, and the plot for his supremacy over
Mazarin, "the plunderer," fell through.</p>

<p>The whole neighbouring region south of the
Loire opposite Nantes, the ancient Pays de
Retz, is unfamiliar to tourists in general, and
for that reason it has an unexpected if not a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">303</a></span>
superlative charm. It was the bloodiest of the
battle-grounds of the Vendean wars, and,
though its monumental remains are not as
numerous or as imposingly beautiful as those
in many other parts, there is an interest about
it all which is as undying as is that of the most
ornate or magnificent château or fortress-peopled
land that ever existed.</p>

<p>Not a corner of this land but has seen bloody
warfare in all its grimness and horror, from the
days when Clisson was pillaged by the Normans
in the ninth century, to the guerilla warfare of
the Vendean republicans in the eighteenth century.
The advent of the railway has changed
much of the aspect of this region and brought
a twentieth-century civilization up to the very
walls of the ruins of Clisson and Maulévrier,
the latter one of the many châteaux of this
region which were ruined by the wars of Stofflet,
who, at the head of the insurgents, obliged
the nobility to follow the peasants in their
uprising.</p>

<p>Now and then, in these parts, one comes upon
a short length of railway line not unlike that
at which our forefathers marvelled. The line
may be of narrow gauge or it may not, but
almost invariably the two or three so-called
carriages are constructed in the style (or lack<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">304</a></span>
of style) of the old stage-coach, and they roll
along in much the same lumbering fashion.
The locomotive itself is a thing to be wondered
at. It is a pigmy in size, but it makes the
commotion of a modern decapod, or one of
those great flyers which pull the Southern Express
on the main line via Poitiers and Angoulême,
not fifty kilometres away.</p>

<p>There is a little tract of land lying just south
of the Loire below Angers which is known as
"le Bocage Vendéen." One leaves the Loire
at Chalonnes and, by a series of gentle inclines,
reaches the plateau where sits the town of
Cholet, the very centre of the region, and a
town whose almost only industry is the manufacture
of pocket-handkerchiefs.</p>

<p>The aspect of the Loire has changed rapidly
and given way to a more vigorous and varied
topography; but, for all that, Cholet and the
surrounding country depend entirely upon the
great towns of the Loire for their intercourse
with the still greater markets beyond. Like
Angers, Cholet and all the neighbouring villages
are slate-roofed, with only an occasional
red tile to give variety to the otherwise gray
and sombre outlook.</p>

<p><i>En route</i> from Chalonnes one passes Chemillé
almost the only market-town of any size<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">305</a></span>
in the district. It is very curious, with its
Romanesque church and its old houses distributed
around an amphitheatre, like the <i>loges</i> in
an opera-house.</p>

<p>This is the very centre of the Bocage, where,
in Revolutionary times, the Republican armies
so frequently fought with the bands of Vendean
fanatics.</p>

<p>The houses of Cholet are well built, but always
with that grayness and sadness of tone
which does not contribute to either brilliancy
of aspect or gaiety of disposition. Save the
grand street which traverses the town from
east to west, the streets are narrow and uncomfortable;
but to make up for all this there are
hotels and cafés as attractive and as comfortable
as any establishments of the kind to be
found in any of the smaller cities of provincial
France.</p>

<p>The handkerchief industry is very considerable,
no less than six great establishments
devoting themselves to the manufacture.</p>

<p>Cholet is one of the greatest cattle markets,
if not the greatest, in the land. The farmers
of the surrounding country buy <i>b&#339;ufs maigres</i>
in the southwest and centre of France and
transform them into good fat cattle which in
every way rival what is known in England as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">306</a></span>
"best English." This is accomplished cheaply
and readily by feeding them with cabbage
stalks.</p>

<p>On Saturdays, on the Champ de Foire, the
aspect is most animated, and any painter who
is desirous of emulating Rosa Bonheur's
"Horse Fair" (painted at the great cattle
market of Bernay, in Normandy) cannot find
a better vantage-ground than here, for one may
see gathered together nearly all the cattle types
of Poitou, the Vendée, Anjou, Bas Maine, and
of Bretagne Nantaise.</p>

<p>In earlier days Cholet was far more sad than
it is to-day; but there remain practically no
souvenirs of its past. The wars of the Vendée
left, it is said, but three houses standing when
the riot and bloodshed was over. Two of the
greatest battles of this furious struggle were
fought here.</p>

<p>On the site of the present railroad station
Kleber and Moreau fought the royalists, and
the heroic Bonchamps received the wound of
which he died at St. Florent, just after he had
put into execution the order of release for five
thousand Republican prisoners. This was on
the 17th October, 1793. Five months later
Stofflet possessed himself of the town and
burned it nearly to the ground. Not much is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">307</a></span>
left to remind one of these eventful times, save
the public garden, which was built on the site
of the old château.</p>

</div>





<p>La Moine, a tiny and most picturesque river,
still flows under the antique arches of the old
bridge, which was held in turn by the Vendeans
and the Republicans.</p>

<p>To the west of Cholet runs another line of
railway, direct through the heart of the Sèvre-Nantaise,
one of those <i>petits pays</i> whose old-time
identity is now all but lost, even more celebrated
in bloody annals than is that region
lying to the eastward. Here was a country
entirely sacked and impoverished. Mortagne
was completely ruined, though it has yet left
substantial remains of its fourteenth and fifteenth
century château. Torfou was the scene
of a bloody encounter between the Vendean
hordes and Kleber's two thousand <i>héroiques
de Mayence</i>. The able Vendean chiefs who
opposed him, Bonchamps, D'Elbée, and Lescure,
captured his artillery and massacred all
the wounded.</p>

<p>At the extremity of this line was the stronghold
of Clisson, which itself finally succumbed,
but later gave birth to a new town to take the
place of that which perished in the Vendean
convulsion.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">308</a></span></p>

<p>Throughout this region, in the valleys of the
Moine and the Sèvre-Nantaise, the rocks and
the verdure and the admirable, though ill preserved,
ruins, all combine to produce as unworldly
an atmosphere as it is possible to conceive
within a short half-hundred kilometres
of the busy world-port of Nantes and the great
commercial city of Angers. One continually
meets with ruins that recall the frightful struggle
of Revolutionary times; hence the impression
that one gets from a ramble through or
about this region is well-nigh unique in all
France.</p>

<p>The coast southward, nearly to La Rochelle,
is a vast series of shallow gulfs and salt
marshes which form weirdly wonderful outlooks
for the painter who inclines to vast expanses
of sea and sky.</p>

<p>Pornic is a remarkably picturesque little seaside
village, where the inflowing and outflowing
tides of the Bay of Biscay temper the southern
sun and make of it&mdash;or would make of it if
the tide of fashion had but set that way&mdash;a
watering-place of the first rank.</p>

<p>It is an entrancing bit of coast-line which
extends for a matter of fifty kilometres south
of the juncture of the Loire with the ocean,
with an aspect at times severe with a waste<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">309</a></span>
of sand, and again gracious with verdure and
tree-clad and rocky shores.</p>

<p>The great Bay of Bourgneuf and its enfolding
peninsula of Noirmoutier form an artist's
sketching-ground that is not yet overrun with
mere dabblers in paint and pencil, and is accordingly
charming.</p>

<p>The Bay of Bourgneuf has most of the characteristics
of the Morbihan, without that severity
and sternness which impress one so deeply
when on the shores of the great Breton inland
sea.</p>

<p>The little town of Bourgneuf-en-Retz, with
its little port of Colletis, is by no means a city
of any artistic worth; indeed it is nearly bare
of most of those things which attract travellers
who are lovers of old or historic shrines;
but it is a delightful stopping-place for all that,
provided one does not want to go farther afield,
to the very tip of the Vendean "land's end"
at Noirmoutier across the bay.</p>

<p>Three times a day a steamer makes the journey
to the little island town which is a favourite
place of pilgrimage for the Nantais during
the summer months. Once it was not even an
island, but a peninsula, and not so very long
ago either. The alluvial deposits of the Loire
made it in the first place, and the sea, back<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">310</a></span>ing
in from the north, made a strait which just
barely separates it to-day from the mainland.</p>

<p>On this out-of-the-way little island there are
still some remains of prehistoric monuments,
the dolmen of Chiron-Tardiveau, the menhirs
of Pinaizeaux and Pierre-Levée, and some
others. In the speech of the inhabitants the
isle is known as Noirmoutier, a contraction of
"<i>Nigrum Monasterium</i>," a name derived from
the monastery founded here in the seventh century
by St. Philibert.</p>

<p>In the town is an old château, the ancient
fortress-refuge of the Abbé of Her. It is a
great square structure flanked at the angles
with little towers, of which two are roofed,
one uncovered, and the fourth surmounted by
a heliograph for communicating with the Ile
de Yeu and the Pointe de Chenoulin. The view
from the heights of these château towers is
fascinating beyond compare, particularly at
sundown on a summer's evening, when the
golden rays of the sinking sun burnish the coast
of the Vendée and cast lingering shadows from
the roof-tops and walls of the town below. To
the northwest one sees the Ilot du Pilier, with
its lighthouse and its tiny coast-guard fortress;
to the north is clearly seen Pornic and the
neighbouring coasts of the Pays de Retz and of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">311</a></span>
Bouin with its encircling dikes,&mdash;all reminiscent
of a little Holland. To the south is the
narrow neck of Fromentin, the jagged Marguerites,
which lift their fangs wholly above the
surface of the sea only at low water, and the
towering cliffs of the Ile de Yeu, which rise
above the mists.</p>

<p>Just south of the Loire, between Nantes and
Bourgneuf, is the Lac de Grand-Lieu, in connection
with which one may hear a new rendering
of an old legend. At one time, it is said,
it was bordered by a city, whose inhabitants,
for their vices, brought down the vengeance of
heaven upon them, even though they cried out
to the powers on high to avert the threatened
flood which rose up out of the lake and overflowed
the banks and swallowed the city and
all evidences of its past. In this last lies the
flaw in the legend; but, like the history of
Sodom, of the Ville d'Ys in Bretagne, and of
Ars in Dauphiné, tradition has kept it alive.</p>

<p>This wicked place of the Loire valley was
called <i>Herbauge</i> or <i>Herbadilla</i>, and, from St.
Philibert at the southern extremity of the lake,
one looks out to-day on a considerable extent
of shallow water, which is as murderous-looking
and as uncanny as a swamp of the Everglades.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">312</a></span></p>

<p>From the central basin flow two tiny rivers,
the Ognon and the Boulogne, which are charming
enough in their way, as also is the route
by highroad from Nantes, but the gray monotonous
lake, across which the wind whistles in
a veritable tempest for more than six months
of the year, is most depressing.</p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">There are various hamlets, with some pretence</span><br />
at advanced civilization about them, scattered
around the borders of the lake, St. Leger,
St. Mars, St. Aignan, St. Lumine, Bouaye, and
La Chevrolière; but in the whole number you
will not get a daily paper that is less than
forty-eight hours old, and nothing but the most
stale news of happenings in the outside world
ever dribbles through. St. Philibert is the
metropolis of these parts, and it has no competitors
for the honour.</p>

<p>At the entrance of the Ognon is the little
village of Passay, built at the foot of a low cliff
which dominates all this part of the lake. It
is a picturesque little village of low houses
and red roofs, with a little sandy beach in the
foreground, through which little rivulets of
soft water trickle and go to make up the greater
body.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">313</a></span></p>


<h2>CHAPTER XV.<span class="pagenum"><a href="#Contents">To ToC</a></span></h2>

<h4>BERRY AND GEORGE SAND'S COUNTRY</h4>


<p>Whether one enters Berry through the valley
of the Cher or the Indre or through the
gateway of Sancerre in the mid-Loire, the impression
is much
the same. The historic
province of
Berry resounds
again and again
with the echoes of
its past, and no
province adjacent
to the Loire is
more prolific in
the things that interest
the curious,
and none is so little
known as the
old province which
was purchased for the Crown by Philippe I.
in 1101.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<a href="images/illus399.png">
<img src="images/illus399_small.png" alt="Berry (Map)" title="Berry (Map)" />
</a>
</div>

<p>With the interior of the province, that por<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">314</a></span>tion
which lies away from the river valleys,
this book has little to do, though the traveller
through the region would hardly omit the episcopal
city of Bourges, and its great transeptless
cathedral, with its glorious front of quintupled
portals. With the cathedral may well
be coupled that other great architectural monument,
the Maison de Jacques C&#339;ur. At Paris
one is asked, "<i>Avez-vous vu le Louvre?</i>" but
at Bourges it is always, "<i>Êtes-vous allé à
Jacques C&#339;ur?</i>" even before one is asked if
he has seen the cathedral.</p>

<p>From the hill which overlooks Sancerre, and
forms a foundation for the still existing tower
of the château belonging to the feudal Counts
of Sancerre, one gets one of the most wonderfully
wide-spread views in all the Loire valley.
The height and its feudal tower stand isolated,
like a rock rising from the ocean. From Cosne
and beyond, on the north, to La Charité, on the
south, is one vast panorama of vineyard, wheat-field,
and luxuriant river-bottom. At a lesser
distance, on the right bank, is the line of the
railroad which threads its way like a serpent
around the bends of the river and its banks.</p>

<p>Below the hill of Sancerre is a huge overgrown
hamlet&mdash;and yet not large enough to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">315</a></span>
be called a village&mdash;surrounding a most curious
church (St. Satur), without either nave
or apse. The old Abbey of St. Satur once
possessed all the lands in the neighbourhood
that were not in the actual possession of the
Counts of Sancerre, and was a power in the
land, as were most of the abbeys throughout
France. The church was begun in 1360-70, on
a most elaborate plan, so extensive in fact
(almost approaching that great work at La
Charité) that it has for ever remained uncompleted.
The history of this little churchly
suburb of Sancerre has been most interesting.
The great Benedictine church was never finished
and has since come to be somewhat of
a ruin. In 1419 the English sacked the abbey
and stole its treasure to the very last precious
stone or piece of gold. A dozen flatboats were
anchored or moored to the banks of the river
facing the abbey, and the monks were transported
thither and held for a ransom of a thousand
crowns each. As everything had already
been taken by their captors, the monks vainly
protested that they had no valuables with which
to meet the demand, and accordingly they were
bound hand and foot and thrown into the river,
to the number of fifty-two, eight only escaping
with their lives. A bloody memory indeed for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">316</a></span>
a fair land which now blossoms with poppies
and roses.</p>

<p>Sancerre, in spite of the etymology of its
name (which comes down from Roman times&mdash;Sacrum
Cæsari), is of feudal origin. Its fortress,
and the Comté as well, were under the
suzerainty of the Counts of Champagne, and
it was the stronghold and refuge of many a
band of guerilla warriors, adventurers, and
marauding thieves.</p>

<p>At the end of the twelfth century a certain
Comte de Sancerre, at the head of a coterie
of bandits called Brabaçons, marched upon
Bourges and invaded the city, killing all who
crossed their path, and firing all isolated dwellings
and many even in the heart of the city.</p>

<p>Sancerre was many times besieged, the most
memorable event of this nature being the attack
of the royalists in 1573 against the
Frondeurs who were shut up in the town. The
defenders were without artillery, but so habituated
were they to the use of the <i>fronde</i> that
for eight months they were able to hold the
city against the foe. From this the <i>fronde</i>
came to be known as the "<i>arquebuse de Sancerre</i>."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317"></a></span></p>

<div class="figright">
<img src="images/illus403_small.jpg" alt="La Tour, Sancerre" title="La Tour, Sancerre" />
<div class="caption"><a href="images/illus403.jpg"><i>La Tour, Sancerre</i></a></div>
</div>


<p>Sancerre is to-day a ruined town, its streets
unequal and tortuous, all up and down hill and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">318</a></span>
blindly rambling off into <i>culs-de-sac</i> which
lead nowhere. Above it all is the fine château,
built in a modern day after the Renaissance
manner, of Mlle. de Crussol, proudly seated on
the very crest of the hill. Within the grounds,
the only part of the domain which is free to the
public, are the ruins of the famous citadel
which was bought by St. Louis, in 1226, from
the Comte Thibaut. The only portion of this
feudal stronghold which remains to-day is
known as the "Tour des Fiefs."</p>

<p>One may enter the grounds and, in the company
of a <i>concierge</i>, ascend to the platform
of this lone tower, whence a wonderful view
of the broad "<i>ruban lumineux</i>" of the Loire
spreads itself out as if fluttering in the wind,
northward and southward, as far as the eye
can reach. Beside it one sees another line of
blue water, as if it were a strand detached from
the broader band. This is the Canal Latéral
de la Loire, one of those inland waterways of
France which add so much to the prosperity
of the land.</p>

<p>Above Sancerre is Gien, another gateway to
Berry, through which the traveller from Paris
through the Orléannais is bound to pass.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/illus405_small.jpg" alt="Château de Gien" title="Château de Gien" />
<div class="caption"><a href="images/illus405.jpg"><i>Château de Gien</i></a></div>
</div>


<p>At a distance of five kilometres or more,
coming from the north, one sees the towers of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">319</a></span>
the château of Gien piercing the horizon. The
château is a most curious affair, with its chainbuilt
blocks of stone, and its red and black&mdash;or
nearly black&mdash;<i>brique</i>, crossed and recrossed
in quaint geometrical designs. It was built in
1494 for Dame Anne de Beaujeau, who was
regent of the kingdom immediately after the
death of Charles VIII. This building replaced
another of a century before, built by Jean-sans-Peur,
where was celebrated the marriage
of his daughter with the Comte de Guise.
Gien's château, too, may be said to be a landmark
on Jeanne d'Arc's route to martyrdom
and fame, for here she made her supplication
to Charles VII. to march on Reims. In Charlemagnian
times this old castle had a predecessor,
which, however, was more a fortress than
a habitable château; but all remains of this
had apparently disappeared before the later
structure made its appearance. Louis XIV.
and Anne of Austria, regent, held a fugitive,
impoverished court in this château, and heard
with fear and trembling the cannon-shots of
the armies of Turenne and Condé at Bleneau,
five leagues distant.</p>

<p>At Nevers or at La Charité one does not get
the view of the Loire that he would like, for,
in one case, the waterway is masked by a row<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">320</a></span>
of houses, and in the other by a series of walled
gardens; but at Gien, where everything is
splendidly theatrical, there is a tree-bordered
quay and innumerable examples of those coquettish
little houses of brick which are not
beautiful, but which set off many a French
riverside landscape as nothing else will.</p>

<p>In Gien's main street there are a multitude
of rare mellowed old houses with sculptured
fronts and high gables. This street twists and
turns until it reaches the old stone and brick
château, with its harmoniously coloured walls,
making a veritable symphony of colour. Each
turn in this old high-street of Gien gives a new
vista of mediævalism quite surprising and
eerielike, as fantastic as the weird pictures of
Doré.</p>

<p>Gien and its neighbour Briare are chiefly
noted commercially for their pottery. Gien
makes crockery ware, and Briare inundates the
entire world with those little porcelain buttons
which one buys in every land.</p>

<p>Crossing the Sologne and entering Berry
from the capital of the Orléannais, or coming
out from Tours by the valley of the Cher, one
comes upon the little visited and out-of-the-way
château of Valençay, in the charming
dainty valley of the Nahon.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">321</a></span></p>

<p>There is some reason for its comparative
neglect by the tourist, for it is on a cross-country
railway line which demands quite a full day
of one's time to get there from Tours and get
away again to the next centre of attraction,
and if one comes by the way of the Orléannais,
he must be prepared to give at least three days
to the surrounding region.</p>

<p>This is the gateway to George Sand's country,
but few English-speaking tourists ever get
here, so it may be safely called unknown.</p>

<p>It is marvellous how France abounds in these
little corners all but unknown to strangers,
even though they lie not far off the beaten
track. The spirit of exploration and travel
in unknown parts, except the Arctic regions,
Thibet, and the Australian desert, seems to be
dying out.</p>

<p>The château of Valençay was formerly inhabited
by Talleyrand, after he had quitted the
bishopric of Autun for politics. It is seated
proudly upon a vast terrace overlooking one
of the most charming bits of the valley of the
Nahon, and is of a thoroughly typical Renaissance
type, built by the great Philibert Delorme
for Jacques d'Étampes in 1540, and only acquired
by the minister of Napoleon and Louis
XVIII. in 1805.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">322</a></span></p>

<p>The architect, in spite of the imposing situation,
is not seen at his best here, for in no way
does it compare with his masterwork at
Anet, or the Tuileries. The expert recognizes
also the hands of two other architects, one of
the Blaisois and the other of Anjou, who in
some measure transformed the edifice in the
reign of François I.</p>

<p>The enormous donjon,&mdash;if it is a donjon,&mdash;with
its great, round corner tower with a dome
above, which looks like nothing so much as an
observatory, is perhaps the outgrowth of an
earlier accessory, but on the whole the edifice
is fully typical of the Renaissance.</p>

<p>The court unites the two widely different
terminations in a fashion more or less approaching
symmetry, but it is only as a whole
that the effect is highly pleasing.</p>

<p>Beyond a <i>balustrade à jour</i> is the Jardin
de la Duchesse, communicating with the park
by a graceful bridge over an ornamental water.
In general the apartments are furnished in the
style of the First Empire, an epoch memorable
in the annals of Valençay.</p>

<div class="figright">
<img src="images/illus411_small.jpg" alt="Château de Valençay" title="Château de Valençay" />
<div class="caption"><a href="images/illus411.jpg"><i>Château de Valençay</i></a></div>
</div>


<p>By the orders of Napoleon many royalties
and ambassadors here received hospitality, and
in 1808-14 it became a gilded cage&mdash;or a
"golden prison," as the French have it&mdash;for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">323</a></span>the Prince of the Asturias, afterward Ferdinand
VII. of Spain, who consoled himself during
his captivity by constructing wolf-traps in
the garden and planting cauliflowers in the
great urns and vases with which the terrace
was set out.</p>

<p>There is a great portrait gallery here, where
is gathered a collection of portraits in miniature
of all the sovereigns who treated with
Talleyrand during his ministerial reign, among
others one of the Sultan Selim, painted from
life, but in secret, since the reproduction of
the human form is forbidden by the Koran.</p>

<p>In the Maison de Charité, in the town, beneath
the pavement of the chapel, is found the
tomb of the family of Talleyrand, where are
interred the remains of Talleyrand and of
Marie Thérèse Poniatowska, sister of the celebrated
King of Poland who served in the
French army in 1806. In this chapel also is
a rare treasure in the form of a chalice enriched
with precious stones, originally belonging
to Pope Pius VI., the gift of the Princess
Poniatowska.</p>

<p>The Pavillon de la Garenne,&mdash;what in England
would be called a "shooting-box,"&mdash;a
rendezvous for the chase, built by Talleyrand,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">324</a></span>
is some distance from the château on the edge
of the delightful little Forêt de Gatine.</p>

<p>Varennes, just above Valençay, is thought by
the average traveller through the long gallery
of charms in the château country to be wholly
unworthy of his attention. As a matter of fact,
it does not possess much of historical or artistic
interest, though its fine old church dates
from the twelfth century.</p>

<p>Ascending the Cher from its juncture with
the Loire, one passes a number of interesting
places. St. Aignan, with its magnificent Gothic
and Renaissance château; Selles; Romorantin,
a dead little spot, dear as much for its sleepiness
as anything else; Vierzon, a rich, industrial
town where they make locomotives, automobiles,
and mechanical hay-rakes, copying the
most approved American models; and Mehun-sur-Yevre,
all follow in rapid succession.</p>

<p>Mehun-sur-Yevre, which to most is only a
name and to many not even that, is possessed
of two architectural monuments, a grand ruin
of a Gothic fortress of the time of Charles VII.
and a feudal gateway of two great rounded
cone-roofed towers, bound by a ligature
through which a port-cullis formerly slid up
and down like an act-drop in a theatre.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325"></a></span></p>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/illus415_small.jpg" alt="Gateway of Mehun-sur-Yevre" title="Gateway of Mehun-sur-Yevre" />
<div class="caption"><a href="images/illus415.jpg"><i>Gateway of Mehun-sur-Yevre</i></a></div>
</div>

<p>Wonderfully impressive all this, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">326</a></span>
more so because these magnificent relics of
other days are unspoiled and unrestored.</p>

<div class="figright">
<img src="images/illus417_small.jpg" alt="Le Carrior Dore, Romorantin" title="Le Carrior Dore, Romorantin" />
<div class="caption"><a href="images/illus417.jpg"><i>Le Carrior Dore, Romorantin</i></a></div>
</div>



<p>Charles VII. was by no means constant in
his devotions, it will be recalled, though he
seems to have been seriously enamoured of
Agnes Sorel&mdash;at any rate while she lived.
Afterward he speedily surrounded himself with
a galaxy of "<i>belles demoiselles vêtues comme
reines</i>." They followed him everywhere, and
he spent all but his last sou upon them, as did
some of his successors.</p>

<p>One day Charles VII. took refuge in the
strong towers of the château of Mehun-sur-Yevre,
which he himself had built and which
he had frequently made his residence. Here
he died miserable and alone,&mdash;it is said by
history, of hunger. Thus another dark chapter
in the history of kings and queens was brought
to a close.</p>

<p>If one has the time and so desires, he may
follow the Indre, the next confluent of the Loire
south of the Cher, from Loches to "George
Sand's country," as literary pilgrims will like
to think of the pleasant valleys of the ancient
province of Berry.</p>

<p>The history of the province before and since
Philippe I. united it with the Crown of France
was vivid enough to make it fairly well known,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">327</a></span>
but on the whole it has been very little travelled.
It is essentially a pastoral region, and,
remembering George Sand and her works, one
has refreshing memories of the idyls of its
prairies and the beautiful valleys of the Indre
and the Cher, which join their waters with the
Loire near Tours.</p>

<p>If one would love Berry as one loves a
greater and more famous haunt of a famous
author, and would prepare in advance for the
pleasure to be received from threading its highways
and byways, he should read those "<i>petits
chefs-d'&#339;uvre</i> of sentiment and rustic poesy",
the romances of George Sand. If he has done
this, he will find almost at every turning some
long familiar spot or a peasant who seems
already an old friend.</p>

<p>Châteauroux is the real gateway to the country
of George Sand.</p>

<p>Nohant is the native place of the great
authoress, Madame Dudevant, whom the world
best knows as George Sand; a little by-corner
of the great busy world, loved by all who know
it. Far out in the open country is the little
station at which one alights if he comes by rail.
Opposite is a "<i>petite route</i>" which leads directly
to the banks of the Indre, where it joins
the highway to La Châtre.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">328</a></span></p>

<p>Nohant itself, as a dainty old-world village,
is divine. Has not George Sand expressed her
love of it as fervidly as did Marie Antoinette
for the Trianon? The French call it a "<i>bon
et honnête petit village berrichon</i>." Nude of
artifice, it is deliciously unspoiled. A delightful
old church, with a curious wooden porch
and a parvise as rural as could possibly be,
not even a cobblestone detracting from its rustic
beauty, is the principal thing which strikes
one's eye as he enters the village. Chickens
and geese wander about, picking here and there
on the very steps of the church, and no one
says them nay.</p>

<p>The house of George Sand is just to the right
of the church, within whose grounds one sees
also the pavilion known to her as the "<i>théâtre
des marionettes</i>."</p>

<p>In a corner of the poetic little cemetery at
Nohant, one sees among the humble crosses
emerging from the midst of the verdure, all
weather-beaten and moss-grown, a plain, simple
stone, green with mossy dampness, which
marks the spot where reposes all that was
mortal of George Sand. Here, in the midst of
this land which she so loved, she still lives in
the memory of all; at the house of the well-lettered
for her abounding talent&mdash;second only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">329</a></span>
to that of Balzac&mdash;and in the homes of the
peasants for her generous fellowship.</p>

<p>Through her ancestry she could and did claim
relationship with Charles X. and Louis XVIII.;
but her life among her people had nought of
pretence in it. She was born among the roses
and to the sound of music, and she lies buried
amid all the rusticity and simple charm of what
may well be called the greenwood of her native
land.

<h2>CHAPTER XVI.<span class="pagenum"><a href="#Contents">To ToC</a></span></h2>

<h4>THE UPPER LOIRE</h4>


<p>The gateway to the upper valley may be
said to be through the Nivernais, and the capital
city of the old province, at the juncture of
the Allier and the Loire.</p>

<p>After leaving Gien and Briare, the Loire
passes through quite the most truly picturesque
landscape of its whole course, the great height
of Sancerre dominating the view for thirty
miles or more in any direction.</p>

<p>Cosne is the first of the towns of note of
the Nivernais, and is a gay little bourg of eight
or nine thousand souls who live much the same
life that their grandfathers lived before them.
As a place of residence it might prove dull
to the outsider, but as a house of call for the
wearied and famished traveller, Cosne, with its
charming situation, its tree-bordered quays,
and its Hôtel du Grand Cerf, is most attractive.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331"></a></span></p>

<div class="figleft">

<div class="caption"><a href="images/illus423.jpg"><i>Église S. Aignan, Cosne</i></a></div>
</div>


<p>Pouilly-sur-Loire is next, with three thou<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">332</a></span>sand
or more inhabitants wholly devoted to
wine-growing, Pouilly being to the upper river
what Vouvray is to Touraine. It is not a tourist
point in any sense, nor is it very picturesque
or attractive.</p>

<p>Some one has said that the pleasure of contemplation
is never so great as when one views
a noble monument, a great work of art, or a
charming French town for the first time.
Never was it more true indeed than of the
two dissimilar towns of the upper Loire,
Nevers, and La Charité-sur-Loire. The old
towers of La Charité rise up in the sunlight
and give that touch to the view which marks
it at once as of the Nivernais, which all archæologists
tell one is Italian and not French, in
motive as well as sentiment.</p>

<p>It is remarkable, perhaps, that the name La
Charité is so seldom met with in the accounts
of English travellers in France, for in France
it is invariably considered to be one of the
most picturesque and famous spots in all mid-France.</p>

<p>It is an unprogressive, sleepy old place, with
streets mostly unpaved, whose five thousand
odd souls, known roundabout as Les Caritates,
live apparently in the past.</p>

<div class="figright">
<img src="images/illus425_small.jpg" alt="Pouilly-sur-Loire" title="Pouilly-sur-Loire" />
<div class="caption"><a href="images/illus425.jpg"><i>Pouilly-sur-Loire</i></a></div>
</div>

<p>Below, a stone's throw from the windows of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">333</a></span>
your inn, lies the Loire, its broad, blue bosom
scarcely ruffled, except where it slowly eddies
around the piers of the two-century-old <i>dos
d'ane</i> bridge; a lovely old structure, built, it
is recorded, by the regiment known as the
"Royal Marine" in the early years of the
eighteenth century.</p>

<p>The town is terraced upon the very edge of
the river, with views up and down which are
unusually lovely for even these parts. Below,
almost within sight, is Nevers, while above are
the heights of Sancerre, still visible in the glowing
western twilight.</p>

<p>Beyond the bridge rises a giant column of
blackened stone, festooned by four ranges of
arcades, the sole remaining relic of the ancient
church standing alone before the present structure
which now serves the purposes of the
church in La Charité.</p>

<p>The walls which surrounded the ancient town
have disappeared or have been built into house
walls, but the effect is still of a self-contained
old burg.</p>

<p>In the fourteenth century, during the Hundred
Years' War, the town was frequently besieged.
In 1429 Jeanne d'Arc, coming from
her success at St. Pierre-le-Moutier, here met
with practically a defeat, as she was able to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">334</a></span>
sustain the siege for only but a month, when
she withdrew.</p>

<p>La Charité played an important part in the
religious wars of the sixteenth century, and
Protestants and Catholics became its occupants
in turn. Virtually La Charité-sur-Loire became
a Protestant stronghold in spite of its
Catholic foundation.</p>

<p>In 1577 it bade defiance to the royal arms of
the Duc d'Alençon, as is recounted by the following
lines:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0_5">"Ou allez-vous, hélas! furieux insensés<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cherchant de Charité la proie et la ruine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Qui sans l'ombre de Foy abbatre la pensez!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&nbsp;&nbsp; . &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  . &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; . &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; . &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; . &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; . &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 <br /></span>
<span class="i0">Le canon ne peut rien contre la Charité,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Plus tot vous détruira la peste et la famine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Car jamais sans Foy n'aurez la Charité."<br /></span>
</div></div>


<p>In spite of this defiance it capitulated, and,
on the 15th of May, at the château of Plessis-les-Tours
on the Loire, Henri III. celebrated
the victory of his brother by a fête
"<i>ultra-galante</i>," where, in place of the usual
pages, there were employed "<i>des dames vestues
en habits d'hommes....</i>" Surely a fantastic
and immodest manner of celebrating a
victory against religious opponents; but, like
many of the customs of the time, the fête was
simply a fanatical debauch.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">335</a></span></p>


<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/illus429_small.jpg" alt="Porte du Croux, Nevers" title="Porte du Croux, Nevers" />
<div class="caption"><a href="images/illus429.jpg"><i>Porte du Croux, Nevers</i></a></div>
</div>



<p>At Nevers one meets the Canal du Nivernais,
which recalls Daudet's "La Belle Nivernaise"
to all readers of fiction, who may accept it without
question as a true and correct guide to the
region, its manners, and customs.</p>

<p>The chief characteristic of Nevers is that it
is Italian in nearly, if not quite all, its aspects;
its monuments and its history. Its ancient ducal
château, part of which dates from the feudal
epoch, was the abode of the Italian dukes who
came in the train of Mazarin, the last of whom
was the nephew of the cardinal, "who himself
was French if his speech was not."</p>

<p>Nevers has also a charming Gothic cathedral
(St. Cyr) with a double Romanesque apse (in
itself a curiosity seldom, if ever, seen out of
Germany), and, in addition to the cathedral,
can boast of St. Etienne, one of the most precious
of all the Romanesque churches of
France.</p>

<p>The old walls at Nevers are not very complete,
but what remain are wonderfully expressive.
The Tour Gouguin and the Tour St. Eloi
are notable examples, but they are completely
overshadowed by the Porte du Croux, which
is one of the best examples of the city gates
which were so plentiful in the France of another
day.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">336</a></span></p>

<p>Above Nevers, Decize, Bourbon-Lancy, Gilly,
and Digoin are mere names which mean nothing
to the traveller by rail. They are busy
towns of central France, where the bustle of
their daily lives is of quite a different variety
from that of the Ile de France, of Normandy,
or of the Pas de Calais.</p>

<p>From Digoin to Roanne the Loire is followed
by the Canal Latéral. Roanne is a not very
pleasing, overgrown town which has become a
veritable <i>ville des ouvriers</i>, all of whom are engaged
in cloth manufacture.</p>

<p>Virtually, then, Roanne is not much more
than a guide-post on the route to Le Puy&mdash;"the
most picturesque place in the world"&mdash;and
the wonderfully impressive region of the
Cevennes and the Vivaris, where shepherds
guard their flocks amid the solitudes.</p>

<p>Far above Le Puy, in a rocky gorge known
as the Gerbier-de-Jonc, near Ste. Eulalie, in
the Ardeche, rises the tiny Liger, which is the
real source of the mighty Loire, that natural
boundary which divides the north from the
south and forms what the French geographers
call "<i>la bassin centrale de France</i>."</p>

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
